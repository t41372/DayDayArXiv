    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic AI combines the interpretability, parsimony, and explicit\nreasoning of classical symbolic approaches with the statistical learning of\ndata-driven neural approaches. Models and policies that are simultaneously\ndifferentiable and interpretable may be key enablers of this marriage. This\npaper demonstrates three pathways to implementing such models and policies in a\nreal-world reinforcement learning setting. Specifically, we study a broad class\nof neural networks that build interpretable semantics directly into their\narchitecture. We reveal and highlight both the potential and the essential\ndifficulties of combining logic, simulation, and learning. One lesson is that\nlearning benefits from continuity and differentiability, but classical logic is\ndiscrete and non-differentiable. The relaxation to real-valued, differentiable\nrepresentations presents a trade-off; the more learnable, the less\ninterpretable. Another lesson is that using logic in the context of a numerical\nsimulation involves a non-trivial mapping from raw (e.g., real-valued time\nseries) simulation data to logical predicates. Some open questions this note\nexposes include: What are the limits of rule-based controllers, and how\nlearnable are they? Do the differentiable interpretable approaches discussed\nhere scale to large, complex, uncertain systems? Can we truly achieve\ninterpretability? We highlight these and other themes across the three\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) holds great potential for uncovering underlying\nmathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast\ncombinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for\nboth online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally,\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration\nof domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions\nwith the model during the equation discovery process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive\nframework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale\ntransformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without\nrelying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to\nlearn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder,\nenabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a\nco-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates\neffective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation\ndiscovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the\nexpression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression\nto best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly\nwhen there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the\nchallenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world\ncases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design\nmechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other\nstate-of-the-art models.

In 2018,\nlicenses with behaviorial-use clauses (commonly referred to as Responsible AI\nLicenses) were proposed to give developers a framework for releasing AI assets\nwhile specifying their users to mitigate negative applications. As of the end\nof 2023, on the order of 40,000 software and model repositories have adopted\nresponsible AI licenses licenses. Notable models licensed with behavioral use\nclauses include BLOOM (language) and LLaMA2 (language), Stable Diffusion\n(image), and GRID (robotics).

We use a mixed-methods methodology of qualitative interviews, clustering\nof license clauses, and quantitative analysis of license adoption. Based on\nthis evidence we take the position that responsible AI licenses need\nstandardization to avoid confusing users or diluting their impact. At the same\ntime, customization of behavioral restrictions is also appropriate in some\ncontexts (e.g., medical domains).

The Ranksum\nobtains the sentence saliency rankings corresponding to each feature in an\nunsupervised way followed by the weighted fusion of the four scores to rank the\nsentences according to their significance. The scores are generated in\ncompletely unsupervised way, and a labeled document set is required to learn\nthe fusion weights. Since we found that the fusion weights can generalize to\nother datasets, we consider the Ranksum as an unsupervised approach. To\ndetermine topic rank, we employ probabilistic topic models whereas semantic\ninformation is captured using sentence embeddings. To derive rankings using\nsentence embeddings, we utilize Siamese networks to produce abstractive\nsentence representation and then we formulate a novel strategy to arrange them\nin their order of importance. A graph-based strategy is applied to find the\nsignificant keywords and related sentence rankings in the document. We also\nformulate a sentence novelty measure based on bigrams, trigrams, and sentence\nembeddings to eliminate redundant sentences from the summary. The ranks of all\nthe sentences computed for each feature are finally fused to get the final\nscore for each sentence in the document.

Methods\n  This work is focused on colorectal cancer, assessing several feature ranking\nalgorithms in terms of performance for a set of risk prediction models (Neural\nNetworks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest\nNeighbors and Boosted Trees). Additionally, their robustness is evaluated\nfollowing a conventional approach with scalar stability metrics and a visual\napproach proposed in this work to study both similarity among feature ranking\ntechniques as well as their individual stability. A comparative analysis is\ncarried out between the most relevant features found out in this study and\nfeatures provided by the experts according to the state-of-the-art knowledge.\nResults\n  The two best performance results in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)\nare achieved with a SVM classifier using the top-41 features selected by the\nSVM wrapper approach (AUC=0.693) and Logistic Regression with the top-40\nfeatures selected by the Pearson (AUC=0.689). Experiments showed that\nperforming feature selection contributes to classification performance with a\n3.9% and 1.9% improvement in AUC for the SVM and Logistic Regression\nclassifier, respectively, with respect to the results using the full feature\nset. The visual approach proposed in this work allows to see that the Neural\nNetwork-based wrapper ranking is the most unstable while the Random Forest is\nthe most stable.",

    "abstract": "A natural approach for reinforcement learning is to predict future rewards by\nunrolling a neural network world model, and to backpropagate through the\nresulting computational graph to learn a policy. However, this method often\nbecomes impractical for long horizons since typical world models induce\nhard-to-optimize loss landscapes. Transformers are known to efficiently\npropagate gradients over long horizons: could they be the solution to this\nproblem? Surprisingly, we show that commonly-used transformer world models\nproduce circuitous gradient paths, which can be detrimental to long-range\npolicy gradients. To tackle this challenge, we propose a class of world models\ncalled Actions World Models (AWMs), designed to provide more direct routes for\ngradient propagation. We integrate such AWMs into a policy gradient framework\nthat underscores the relationship between network architectures and the policy\ngradient updates they inherently represent. We demonstrate that AWMs can\ngenerate optimization landscapes that are easier to navigate even when compared\nto those from the simulator itself. This property allows transformer AWMs to\nproduce better policies than competitive baselines in realistic long-horizon\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms through which neural networks extract statistics\nfrom input-label pairs through feature learning is one of the most important\nunsolved problems in supervised learning. Prior works demonstrated that the\ngram matrices of the weights (the neural feature matrices, NFM) and the average\ngradient outer products (AGOP) become correlated during training, in a\nstatement known as the neural feature ansatz (NFA). Through the NFA, the\nauthors introduce mapping with the AGOP as a general mechanism for neural\nfeature learning. However, these works do not provide a theoretical explanation\nfor this correlation or its origins. In this work, we further clarify the\nnature of this correlation, and explain its emergence. We show that this\ncorrelation is equivalent to alignment between the left singular structure of\nthe weight matrices and the newly defined pre-activation tangent features at\neach layer. We further establish that the alignment is driven by the\ninteraction of weight changes induced by SGD with the pre-activation features,\nand analyze the resulting dynamics analytically at early times in terms of\nsimple statistics of the inputs and labels. We prove the derivative alignment\noccurs almost surely in specific high dimensional settings.

    "abstract": "The large increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have\nrevolutionised the way data is processed, which added to the current trend from\ncloud to edge computing has resulted in the need for efficient and reliable\ndata processing near the data sources using energy-efficient devices. Two\nmethods based on low-cost edge-IoT architectures are proposed to implement\nlightweight Machine Learning (ML) models that estimate indoor environmental\nquality (IEQ) parameters, such as Artificial Neural Networks of Multilayer\nPerceptron type. Their implementation is based on centralised and distributed\nparallel IoT architectures, connected via wireless, which share commercial\noff-the-self modules for data acquisition and sensing, such as sensors for\ntemperature, humidity, illuminance, CO2, and other gases. The centralised\nmethod uses a Graphics Processing Unit and the Message Queuing Telemetry\nTransport protocol, but the distributed method utilises low performance\nARM-based devices and the Message Passing Interface protocol. Although multiple\nIEQ parameters are measured, the training and testing of ML models is\naccomplished with experiments focused on small temperature and illuminance\ndatasets to reduce data processing load, obtained from sudden spikes, square\nprofiles and sawteeth test cases. The results show a high estimation\nperformance with F-score and Accuracy values close to 0.95, and an almost\ntheorical Speedup with a reduction in power consumption close to 37% in the\ndistributed parallel approach. In addition, similar or slightly better\nperformance is achieved compared to equivalent IoT architectures from related\nresearch, but error reduction of 35 to 76% is accomplished with an adequate\nbalance between performance and energy efficiency.",

On toy problems, we empirically find that: (1)\nThe loss of a subtask is inversely proportional to its allocated neurons. (2)\nWhen multiple subtasks are present in a composite task, the resources acquired\nby each subtask uniformly grow as models get larger, keeping the ratios of\nacquired resources constants. We hypothesize these findings to be generally\ntrue and build a model to predict neural scaling laws for general composite\ntasks, which successfully replicates the neural scaling law of Chinchilla\nmodels reported in arXiv:2203.15556. We believe that the notion of resource\nused in this paper will be a useful tool for characterizing and diagnosing\nneural networks.",

We develop methods\nto identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are\ndisentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels.\nSurprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\\%$\nat the parameter level and $2.5\\%$ at the rank level.

However, aligning models to serve pluralistic human values\nremains an open research question. In this piece, we propose a roadmap to\npluralistic alignment, specifically using language models as a test bed. We\nidentify and formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize\npluralism in AI systems: 1) Overton pluralistic models that present a spectrum\nof reasonable responses; 2) Steerably pluralistic models that can steer to\nreflect certain perspectives; and 3) Distributionally pluralistic models that\nare well-calibrated to a given population in distribution. We also formalize\nand discuss three possible classes of pluralistic benchmarks: 1)\nMulti-objective benchmarks, 2) Trade-off steerable benchmarks, which\nincentivize models to steer to arbitrary trade-offs, and 3) Jury-pluralistic\nbenchmarks which explicitly model diverse human ratings. We use this framework\nto argue that current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for\npluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical evidence, both from our own\nexperiments and from other work, that standard alignment procedures might\nreduce distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further\nresearch on pluralistic alignment.",

Interestingly, there\nare substantial discussions of data, sometimes with equal or even greater\nemphasis than the model itself. To evaluate the impact of model cards, we\nconducted an intervention study by adding detailed model cards to 42 popular\nmodels which had no or sparse model cards previously.

To\novercome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative\ntraining-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge\nGraph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively\nexplore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to\nsupport reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent\nimplicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the\nreasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves\nmore reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the\nreasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly\nprogressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement\non the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to\noffer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs,\nthereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues.",

    "abstract": "Trust plays an essential role in an individual's decision-making. Traditional\ntrust prediction models rely on pairwise correlations to infer potential\nrelationships between users. However, in the real world, interactions between\nusers are usually complicated rather than pairwise only. Hypergraphs offer a\nflexible approach to modeling these complex high-order correlations (not just\npairwise connections), since hypergraphs can leverage hyperedeges to link more\nthan two nodes. However, most hypergraph-based methods are generic and cannot\nbe well applied to the trust prediction task. In this paper, we propose an\nAdaptive Hypergraph Network for Trust Prediction (AHNTP), a novel approach that\nimproves trust prediction accuracy by using higher-order correlations. AHNTP\nutilizes Motif-based PageRank to capture high-order social influence\ninformation. In addition, it constructs hypergroups from both node-level and\nstructure-level attributes to incorporate complex correlation information.\nFurthermore, AHNTP leverages adaptive hypergraph Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) layers and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to generate comprehensive user\nembeddings, facilitating trust relationship prediction. To enhance model\ngeneralization and robustness, we introduce a novel supervised contrastive\nlearning loss for optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our model over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of trust\nprediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly\nbelieved to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still\nperform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the\nAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach ARC as a\nprogramming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for\nlanguage model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method\niterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning\nfrom prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e.,\nthe target program output given input) to the realized output produced by the\nsampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of\nrewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we\ndemonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and\ndata-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the\nfirst neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset.\nOur method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines.

Despite numerous studies on accident\nprediction over the past decades, many have limitations in terms of\ngeneralizability, reproducibility, or feasibility for practical use due to\ninput data or problem formulation. To address existing shortcomings, we propose\nCrashFormer, a multi-modal architecture that utilizes comprehensive (but\nrelatively easy to obtain) inputs such as the history of accidents, weather\ninformation, map images, and demographic information. The model predicts the\nfuture risk of accidents on a reasonably acceptable cadence (i.e., every six\nhours) for a geographical location of 5.161 square kilometers. CrashFormer is\ncomposed of five components: a sequential encoder to utilize historical\naccidents and weather data, an image encoder to use map imagery data, a raw\ndata encoder to utilize demographic information, a feature fusion module for\naggregating the encoded features, and a classifier that accepts the aggregated\ndata and makes predictions accordingly. Results from extensive real-world\nexperiments in 10 major US cities show that CrashFormer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential and non-sequential models by 1.8% in F1-score on\naverage when using ``sparse'' input data.",

Moreover, responses in these\ndatasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being\naligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is\ninevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and\nimproves DAP methods.

Commonly used approach of using a\nprojection layer on top of the policy network requires solving an optimization\nprogram which can result in longer training time, slow convergence, and zero\ngradient problem. To address this, first we use a normalizing flow model to\nlearn an invertible, differentiable mapping between the feasible action space\nand the support of a simple distribution on a latent variable, such as\nGaussian. Second, learning the flow model requires sampling from the feasible\naction space, which is also challenging. We develop multiple methods, based on\nHamiltonian Monte-Carlo and probabilistic sentential decision diagrams for such\naction sampling for convex and non-convex constraints. Third, we integrate the\nlearned normalizing flow with the DDPG algorithm. By design, a well-trained\nnormalizing flow will transform policy output into a valid action without\nrequiring an optimization solver.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become proficient in addressing complex\ntasks by leveraging their extensive internal knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities. However, the black-box nature of these models complicates the\ntask of explaining their decision-making processes. While recent advancements\ndemonstrate the potential of leveraging LLMs to self-explain their predictions\nthrough natural language (NL) explanations, their explanations may not\naccurately reflect the LLMs' decision-making process due to a lack of fidelity\noptimization on the derived explanations. Measuring the fidelity of NL\nexplanations is a challenging issue, as it is difficult to manipulate the input\ncontext to mask the semantics of these explanations. To this end, we introduce\nFaithLM to explain the decision of LLMs with NL explanations. Specifically,\nFaithLM designs a method for evaluating the fidelity of NL explanations by\nincorporating the contrary explanations to the query process. Moreover, FaithLM\nconducts an iterative process to improve the fidelity of derived explanations.\nExperiment results on three datasets from multiple domains demonstrate that\nFaithLM can significantly improve the fidelity of derived explanations, which\nalso provides a better alignment with the ground-truth explanations.",

Its\napplications span various domains, including transfer learning, federated\nlearning, and neural architecture search. The most popular methods for\nconstructing the synthetic data rely on matching the convergence properties of\ntraining the model with the synthetic dataset and the training dataset.\nHowever, using the empirical loss as the criterion must be thought of as\nauxiliary in the same sense that the training set is an approximate substitute\nfor the population distribution, and the latter is the data of interest. Yet\ndespite its popularity, an aspect that remains unexplored is the relationship\nof DD to its generalization, particularly across uncommon subgroups.

Here, the\nrepresentativeness and coverage of the dataset become salient over the\nguaranteed training error at inference. Drawing inspiration from\ndistributionally robust optimization, we introduce an algorithm that combines\nclustering with the minimization of a risk measure on the loss to conduct DD.\nWe provide a theoretical rationale for our approach and demonstrate its\neffective generalization and robustness across subgroups through numerical\nexperiments.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in complex\nautonomous driving scenarios. However, DRL models inevitably bring high memory\nconsumption and computation, which hinders their wide deployment in\nresource-limited autonomous driving devices. Structured Pruning has been\nrecognized as a useful method to compress and accelerate DRL models, but it is\nstill challenging to estimate the contribution of a parameter (i.e., neuron) to\nDRL models. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic structured pruning\napproach that gradually removes a DRL model's unimportant neurons during the\ntraining stage. Our method consists of two steps, i.e. training DRL models with\na group sparse regularizer and removing unimportant neurons with a dynamic\npruning threshold. To efficiently train the DRL model with a small number of\nimportant neurons, we employ a neuron-importance group sparse regularizer. In\ncontrast to conventional regularizers, this regularizer imposes a penalty on\nredundant groups of neurons that do not significantly influence the output of\nthe DRL model. Furthermore, we design a novel structured pruning strategy to\ndynamically determine the pruning threshold and gradually remove unimportant\nneurons with a binary mask. Therefore, our method can remove not only redundant\ngroups of neurons of the DRL model but also achieve high and robust\nperformance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive\nwith existing DRL pruning methods on discrete control environments (i.e.,\nCartPole-v1 and LunarLander-v2) and MuJoCo continuous environments (i.e.,\nHopper-v3 and Walker2D-v3). Specifically, our method effectively compresses\n$93\\%$ neurons and $96\\%$ weights of the DRL model in four challenging DRL\nenvironments with slight accuracy degradation.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is becoming widely used for leveraging the power of pre-trained\nfoundation models in new downstream tasks. While there are many successes of\nfine-tuning on various tasks, recent studies have observed challenges in the\ngeneralization of fine-tuned models to unseen distributions (i.e.,\nout-of-distribution; OOD). To improve OOD generalization, some previous studies\nidentify the limitations of fine-tuning data and regulate fine-tuning to\npreserve the general representation learned from pre-training data. However,\npotential limitations in the pre-training data and models are often ignored. In\nthis paper, we contend that overly relying on the pre-trained representation\nmay hinder fine-tuning from learning essential representations for downstream\ntasks and thus hurt its OOD generalization. It can be especially catastrophic\nwhen new tasks are from different (sub)domains compared to pre-training data.\nTo address the issues in both pre-training and fine-tuning data, we propose a\nnovel generalizable fine-tuning method LEVI (Layer-wise Ensemble of different\nVIews), where the pre-trained model is adaptively ensembled layer-wise with a\nsmall task-specific model, while preserving its efficiencies. By combining two\ncomplementing models, LEVI effectively suppresses problematic features in both\nthe fine-tuning data and pre-trained model and preserves useful features for\nnew tasks. Broad experiments with large language and vision models show that\nLEVI greatly improves fine-tuning generalization via emphasizing different\nviews from fine-tuning data and pre-trained features.",

Common solutions often involve continual pre-training on longer\nsequences, which will introduce expensive computational overhead and\nuncontrollable change in model capabilities. In this paper, we unveil the\nintrinsic capacity of LLMs for understanding extremely long sequences without\nany fine-tuning. To this end, we introduce a training-free memory-based method,\nInfLLM. Specifically, InfLLM stores distant contexts into additional memory\nunits and employs an efficient mechanism to lookup token-relevant units for\nattention computation.

Without any training, InfLLM enables LLMs that are pre-trained on\nsequences consisting of a few thousand tokens to achieve comparable performance\nwith competitive baselines that continually train these LLMs on long sequences.\nEven when the sequence length is scaled to $1,024$K, InfLLM still effectively\ncaptures long-distance dependencies.

    "abstract": "Video sequences exhibit significant nuisance variations (undesired effects)\nof speed of actions, temporal locations, and subjects' poses, leading to\ntemporal-viewpoint misalignment when comparing two sets of frames or evaluating\nthe similarity of two sequences. Thus, we propose Joint tEmporal and cAmera\nviewpoiNt alIgnmEnt (JEANIE) for sequence pairs. In particular, we focus on 3D\nskeleton sequences whose camera and subjects' poses can be easily manipulated\nin 3D. We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), where\nmatching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) of\nsupport-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) is\nessential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, we\ncreate its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a support\nsequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popular\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can be\nmatched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporal\nindex, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpoint\nwarping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths with\ndifferent temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which only\nperforms temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin to\nclustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure. JEANIE achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120, Kinetics-skeleton and UWA3D\nMultiview Activity II on supervised and unsupervised FSAR, and their\nmeta-learning inspired fusion.",

Thus, we want to find a minimal subset of\nthe product family that allows us to test all these possible combinations\n(pairwise). Furthermore, when testing a single product is a great effort, it is\ndesirable to first test products composed of a set of priority features. This\nproblem is called Prioritized Pairwise Test Data Generation Problem.\n  State-of-the-art algorithms based on Integer Linear Programming for this\nproblema are faster enough for small and medium instances.

Also, these heuristics not always lead us to the best\nsolutions. In this work we propose a new approach based on a hybrid\nmetaheuristic algorithm called Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt. We compare this\nmatheuristic with four algorithms: a Hybrid algorithm based on Integer Linear\nProgramming ((HILP), a Hybrid algorithm based on Integer Nonlinear Programming\n(HINLP), the Parallel Prioritized Genetic Solver (PPGS), and a greedy algorithm\ncalled prioritized-ICPL.

This motivates the study of task-agnostic\ncontinual multi-label learning problems. While algorithms using deep learning\napproaches for continual multi-label learning have been proposed in the recent\nliterature, they tend to be computationally heavy. Although spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) offer a computationally efficient alternative to artificial\nneural networks, existing literature has not used SNNs for continual\nmulti-label learning. Also, accurately determining multiple labels with SNNs is\nstill an open research problem. This work proposes a dual output spiking\narchitecture (DOSA) to bridge these research gaps. A novel imbalance-aware loss\nfunction is also proposed, improving the multi-label classification performance\nof the model by making it more robust to data imbalance. A modified F1 score is\npresented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function in\nhandling imbalance.

Most existing methods based on Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nare difficult to implement in the real world due to unrealistic assumptions,\nsuch as having access to environment dynamics, reward signals, and online\ninteractions with the environment. To address these limitations, we propose an\nunsupervised method named Offline Imitation Learning based Anomaly Detection\n(OIL-AD), which detects anomalies in decision-making sequences using two\nextracted behaviour features: action optimality and sequential association. Our\noffline learning model is an adaptation of behavioural cloning with a\ntransformer policy network, where we modify the training process to learn a Q\nfunction and a state value function from normal trajectories. We propose that\nthe Q function and the state value function can provide sufficient information\nabout agents' behavioural data, from which we derive two features for anomaly\ndetection. The intuition behind our method is that the action optimality\nfeature derived from the Q function can differentiate the optimal action from\nothers at each local state, and the sequential association feature derived from\nthe state value function has the potential to maintain the temporal\ncorrelations between decisions (state-action pairs). Our experiments show that\nOIL-AD can achieve outstanding online anomaly detection performance with up to\n34.8% improvement in F1 score over comparable baselines.",

In this work, we propose an attention-guided\nvisualization method applied to ViT that provides a high-level semantic\nexplanation for its decision. Our method selectively aggregates the gradients\ndirectly propagated from the classification output to each self-attention,\ncollecting the contribution of image features extracted from each location of\nthe input image. These gradients are additionally guided by the normalized\nself-attention scores, which are the pairwise patch correlation scores. They\nare used to supplement the gradients on the patch-level context information\nefficiently detected by the self-attention mechanism. This approach of our\nmethod provides elaborate high-level semantic explanations with great\nlocalization performance only with the class labels. As a result, our method\noutperforms the previous leading explainability methods of ViT in the\nweakly-supervised localization task and presents great capability in capturing\nthe full instances of the target class object.

Hence, the gradient calculated by\nthe agent can be stochastic and without valid information. Recent studies that\nutilize memory buffers of previous experiences can lead to a more efficient\nlearning process. However, existing methods often require these experiences to\nbe successful and may overly exploit them, which can cause the agent to adopt\nsuboptimal behaviors. This paper develops an approach that uses diverse past\ntrajectories for faster and more efficient online RL, even if these\ntrajectories are suboptimal or not highly rewarded. The proposed algorithm\ncombines a policy improvement step with an additional exploration step using\noffline demonstration data. The main contribution of this paper is that by\nregarding diverse past trajectories as guidance, instead of imitating them, our\nmethod directs its policy to follow and expand past trajectories while still\nbeing able to learn without rewards and approach optimality. Furthermore, a\nnovel diversity measurement is introduced to maintain the team's diversity and\nregulate exploration. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on discrete and\ncontinuous control tasks with sparse and deceptive rewards.

    "abstract": "Next-gen networks require significant evolution of management to enable\nautomation and adaptively adjust network configuration based on traffic\ndynamics. The advent of software-defined networking (SDN) and programmable\nswitches enables flexibility and programmability. However, traditional\ntechniques that decide traffic policies are usually based on hand-crafted\nprogramming optimization and heuristic algorithms. These techniques make\nnon-realistic assumptions, e.g., considering static network load and topology,\nto obtain tractable solutions, which are inadequate for next-gen networks. In\nthis paper, we design and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach\nfor adaptive traffic routing. We design a deep graph convolutional neural\nnetwork (DGCNN) integrated into the DRL framework to learn the traffic behavior\nfrom not only the network topology but also link and node attributes. We adopt\nthe Deep Q-Learning technique to train the DGCNN model in the DRL framework\nwithout the need for a labeled training dataset, enabling the framework to\nquickly adapt to traffic dynamics. The model leverages q-value estimates to\nselect the routing path for every traffic flow request, balancing exploration\nand exploitation. We perform extensive experiments with various traffic\npatterns and compare the performance of the proposed approach with the Open\nShortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. The experimental results show the\neffectiveness and adaptiveness of the proposed framework by increasing the\nnetwork throughput by up to 7.8% and reducing the traffic delay by up to 16.1%\ncompared to OSPF.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI), organizations are\nat the epicenter of a seismic shift, facing a crucial question: How can AI be\nsuccessfully integrated into existing operations? To help answer it, manage\nexpectations and mitigate frustration, this article introduces Computational\nManagement, a systematic approach to task automation for enhancing the ability\nof organizations to harness AI's potential within existing workflows.\nComputational Management acts as a bridge between the strategic insights of\nmanagement science with the analytical rigor of computational thinking. The\narticle offers three easy step-by-step procedures to begin the process of\nimplementing AI within a workflow. Such procedures focus on task\n(re)formulation, on the assessment of the automation potential of tasks, on the\ncompletion of task specification templates for AI selection and adaptation.\nIncluded in the article there are manual and automated methods, with prompt\nsuggestions for publicly available LLMs, to complete these three procedures.\nThe first procedure, task (re)formulation, focuses on breaking down work\nactivities into basic units, so they can be completed by one agent, involve a\nsingle well-defined action, and produce a distinct outcome. The second, allows\nthe assessment of the granular task and its suitability for automation, using\nthe Task Automation Index to rank tasks based on whether they have standardized\ninput, well-defined rules, repetitiveness, data dependency, and objective\noutputs. The third, focuses on a task specification template which details\ninformation on 16 critical components of tasks, and can be used as a checklist\nto select or adapt the most suitable AI solution for integration into existing\nworkflows. Computational Management provides a roadmap and a toolkit for humans\nand AI to thrive together, while enhancing organizational efficiency and\ninnovation.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses chess, a landmark planning problem in AI, to assess\ntransformers' performance on a planning task where memorization is futile\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ even at a large scale. To this end, we release ChessBench, a\nlarge-scale benchmark dataset of 10 million chess games with legal move and\nvalue annotations (15 billion data points) provided by Stockfish 16, the\nstate-of-the-art chess engine. We train transformers with up to 270 million\nparameters on ChessBench via supervised learning and perform extensive\nablations to assess the impact of dataset size, model size, architecture type,\nand different prediction targets (state-values, action-values, and behavioral\ncloning). Our largest models learn to predict action-values for novel boards\nquite accurately, implying highly non-trivial generalization. Despite\nperforming no explicit search, our resulting chess policy solves challenging\nchess puzzles and achieves a surprisingly strong Lichess blitz Elo of 2895\nagainst humans (grandmaster level). We also compare to Leela Chess Zero and\nAlphaZero (trained without supervision via self-play) with and without search.\nWe show that, although a remarkably good approximation of Stockfish's\nsearch-based algorithm can be distilled into large-scale transformers via\nsupervised learning, perfect distillation is still beyond reach, thus making\nChessBench well-suited for future research.",

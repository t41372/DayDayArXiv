    "abstract": "Leveraging the power of a graph neural network (GNN) with message passing, we\npresent a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method to solve stochastic\norienteering problems with chance constraints. While adhering to an assigned\ntravel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring\nstochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of\nexceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS\nsolution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution\nthat determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the\nremaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in\nthe MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both\nthe utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to\nenormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that\nwith the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve\ncomplex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of\ncollected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of\ngeneralizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has become one of the standard approaches for\ndeploying machine learning models on edge devices, where private training data\nare distributed across clients, and a shared model is learned by aggregating\nlocally computed updates from each client. While this paradigm enhances\ncommunication efficiency by only requiring updates at the end of each training\nepoch, the transmitted model updates remain vulnerable to malicious tampering,\nposing risks to the integrity of the global model. Although current digital\nsignature algorithms can protect these communicated model updates, they fail to\nensure quantum security in the era of large-scale quantum computing.\nFortunately, various post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been developed\nto address this vulnerability, especially the three NIST-standardized\nalgorithms - Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+. In this work, we empirically\ninvestigate the impact of these three NIST-standardized PQC algorithms for\ndigital signatures within the FL procedure, covering a wide range of models,\ntasks, and FL settings.

    "abstract": "Digital pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by enabling the\ndigitization, storage, and analysis of tissue samples as whole slide images\n(WSIs). WSIs are gigapixel files that capture the intricate details of tissue\nsamples, providing a rich source of information for diagnostic and research\npurposes. However, due to their enormous size, representing these images as one\ncompact vector is essential for many computational pathology tasks, such as\nsearch and retrieval, to ensure efficiency and scalability. Most current\nmethods are \"patch-oriented,\" meaning they divide WSIs into smaller patches for\nprocessing, which prevents a holistic analysis of the entire slide.\nAdditionally, the necessity for compact representation is driven by the\nexpensive high-performance storage required for WSIs. Not all hospitals have\naccess to such extensive storage solutions, leading to potential disparities in\nhealthcare quality and accessibility. This paper provides an overview of\nexisting set-based approaches to single-vector WSI representation, highlighting\nthe innovations that allow for more efficient and effective use of these\ncomplex images in digital pathology, thus addressing both computational\nchallenges and storage limitations.",

In this paper, we address this gap by\nstudying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov\ngames.

They\nhave the potential to disrupt the system's stability like frequency stability,\nthereby leading to catastrophic failures. Therefore, an FDIA detection method\nwould be valuable to protect power systems. FDIAs typically induce a\ndiscrepancy between the desired and the effective behavior of the power system\ndynamics. A suitable detection method can leverage power dynamics predictions\nto identify whether such a discrepancy was induced by an FDIA. This work\ninvestigates the efficacy of temporal and spatio-temporal state prediction\nmodels, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a combination of Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNN) with LSTM, for predicting frequency dynamics in the absence of\nan FDIA but with noisy measurements, and thereby identify FDIA events. For\ndemonstration purposes, the IEEE 39 New England Kron-reduced model simulated\nwith a swing equation is considered. It is shown that the proposed state\nprediction models can be used as a building block for developing an effective\nFDIA detection method that can maintain high detection accuracy across various\nattack and deployment settings. It is also shown how the FDIA detection should\nbe deployed to limit its exposure to detection inaccuracies and mitigate its\ncomputational burden.",

    "abstract": "Compositing an object into an image involves multiple non-trivial sub-tasks\nsuch as object placement and scaling, color/lighting harmonization,\nviewpoint/geometry adjustment, and shadow/reflection generation. Recent\ngenerative image compositing methods leverage diffusion models to handle\nmultiple sub-tasks at once. However, existing models face limitations due to\ntheir reliance on masking the original object during training, which constrains\ntheir generation to the input mask. Furthermore, obtaining an accurate input\nmask specifying the location and scale of the object in a new image can be\nhighly challenging. To overcome such limitations, we define a novel problem of\nunconstrained generative object compositing, i.e., the generation is not\nbounded by the mask, and train a diffusion-based model on a synthesized paired\ndataset. Our first-of-its-kind model is able to generate object effects such as\nshadows and reflections that go beyond the mask, enhancing image realism.\nAdditionally, if an empty mask is provided, our model automatically places the\nobject in diverse natural locations and scales, accelerating the compositing\nworkflow. Our model outperforms existing object placement and compositing\nmodels in various quality metrics and user studies.",

However, learnable\nupdate rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al.\n(2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight\nnowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the\noptimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts\n(predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron\ninteraction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages\nneuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast\nparameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers,\nmodeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and\nother limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50%\nin vision and language tasks.",

To overcome\nthis challenge, we are investigating hybrid spiking neural networks for\nembedded neural decoding in wireless iBMIs. The networks consist of a temporal\nconvolution-based compression followed by recurrent processing and a final\ninterpolation back to the original sequence length.

To that end, we train\ndecoders on the \"Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor\nCortex Electrophysiology\" dataset and evaluate it using the NeuroBench\nframework, targeting both tracks of the IEEE BioCAS Grand Challenge on Neural\nDecoding. Our approach achieves high accuracy in predicting velocities of\nprimate reaching movements from multichannel primary motor cortex recordings\nwhile maintaining a low number of synaptic operations, surpassing the current\nbaseline models in the NeuroBench framework.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in Large Vision Models (LVMs), such as Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) and diffusion models, have led to an increasing demand for\ncomputational resources, resulting in substantial financial and environmental\ncosts. This growing challenge highlights the necessity of developing efficient\ntraining methods for LVMs. Progressive learning, a training strategy in which\nmodel capacity gradually increases during training, has shown potential in\naddressing these challenges. In this paper, we present an advanced automated\nprogressive learning (AutoProg) framework for efficient training of LVMs. We\nbegin by focusing on the pre-training of LVMs, using ViTs as a case study, and\npropose AutoProg-One, an AutoProg scheme featuring momentum growth (MoGrow) and\na one-shot growth schedule search. Beyond pre-training, we extend our approach\nto tackle transfer learning and fine-tuning of LVMs. We expand the scope of\nAutoProg to cover a wider range of LVMs, including diffusion models. First, we\nintroduce AutoProg-Zero, by enhancing the AutoProg framework with a novel\nzero-shot unfreezing schedule search, eliminating the need for one-shot\nsupernet training. Second, we introduce a novel Unique Stage Identifier (SID)\nscheme to bridge the gap during network growth. These innovations, integrated\nwith the core principles of AutoProg, offer a comprehensive solution for\nefficient training across various LVM scenarios. Extensive experiments show\nthat AutoProg accelerates ViT pre-training by up to 1.85x on ImageNet and\naccelerates fine-tuning of diffusion models by up to 2.86x, with comparable or\neven higher performance. This work provides a robust and scalable approach to\nefficient training of LVMs, with potential applications in a wide range of\nvision tasks. Code: https://github.com/changlin31/AutoProg-Zero",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Medical images acquired using different scanners and protocols can\ndiffer substantially in their appearance. This phenomenon, scanner domain\nshift, can result in a drop in the performance of deep neural networks which\nare trained on data acquired by one scanner and tested on another. This\nsignificant practical issue is well-acknowledged, however, no systematic study\nof the issue is available across different modalities and diagnostic tasks.\nMaterials and Methods: In this paper, we present a broad experimental study\nevaluating the impact of scanner domain shift on convolutional neural network\nperformance for different automated diagnostic tasks. We evaluate this\nphenomenon in common radiological modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI.\nResults: We find that network performance on data from a different scanner is\nalmost always worse than on same-scanner data, and we quantify the degree of\nperformance drop across different datasets. Notably, we find that this drop is\nmost severe for MRI, moderate for X-ray, and quite small for CT, on average,\nwhich we attribute to the standardized nature of CT acquisition systems which\nis not present in MRI or X-ray. We also study how injecting varying amounts of\ntarget domain data into the training set, as well as adding noise to the\ntraining data, helps with generalization. Conclusion: Our results provide\nextensive experimental evidence and quantification of the extent of performance\ndrop caused by scanner domain shift in deep learning across different\nmodalities, with the goal of guiding the future development of robust deep\nlearning models for medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven algorithm design automatically adapts algorithms to specific\napplication domains, achieving better performance. In the context of\nparameterized algorithms, this approach involves tuning the algorithm's\nhyperparameters using problem instances drawn from the problem distribution of\nthe target application domain. This can be achieved by maximizing empirical\nutilities that measure the algorithms' performance as a function of their\nhyperparameters, using problem instances. While empirical evidence supports the\neffectiveness of data-driven algorithm design, providing theoretical guarantees\nfor several parameterized families remains challenging. This is due to the\nintricate behaviors of their corresponding utility functions, which typically\nadmit piecewise discontinuous structures. In this work, we present refined\nframeworks for providing learning guarantees for parameterized data-driven\nalgorithm design problems in both distributional and online learning settings.\nFor the distributional learning setting, we introduce the \\textit{Pfaffian GJ\nframework}, an extension of the classical \\textit{GJ framework}, that is\ncapable of providing learning guarantees for function classes for which the\ncomputation involves Pfaffian functions. Unlike the GJ framework, which is\nlimited to function classes with computation characterized by rational\nfunctions, our proposed framework can deal with function classes involving\nPfaffian functions, which are much more general and widely applicable. We then\nshow that for many parameterized algorithms of interest, their utility function\npossesses a \\textit{refined piecewise structure}, which automatically\ntranslates to learning guarantees using our proposed framework.",

First, the positive\nlinear constraint covers a wide range of CO problems, indicating that our\napproach breaks the generality bottleneck of existing non-autoregressive\nnetworks.

Fourth, our online differentiable search method\nsignificantly improves the generalizability of our neural network solver to\nunseen problems. We validate the effectiveness of this framework in solving\nrepresentative CO problems including facility location, max-set covering, and\ntraveling salesman problem. Our non-autoregressive neural solvers are\ncompetitive to and can be even superior to state-of-the-art solvers such as\nSCIP and Gurobi, especially when both efficiency and efficacy are considered.\nCode is available at https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/NAR-CO-Solver",

This year's SemTab\nchallenge introduced the ``Metadata to KG'' track, which focuses on performing\nSTI by using only metadata information, without access to the underlying data.\nIn response to this new challenge, we introduce a new term: Column Vocabulary\nAssociation (CVA). This term refers to the task of semantic annotation of\ncolumn headers solely based on metadata information. In this study, we evaluate\nthe performance of various methods in executing the CVA task, including a Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, as\nwell as a more traditional similarity approach with SemanticBERT. Our\nmethodology uses a zero-shot setting, with no pretraining or examples passed to\nthe Large Language Models (LLMs), as we aim to avoid a domain-specific setting.\n  We investigate a total of 7 different LLMs, of which three commercial GPT\nmodels (i.e. gpt-3.5-turbo-0.125, gpt-4o and gpt-4-turbo) and four open source\nmodels (i.e. llama3-80b, llama3-7b, gemma-7b and mixtral-8x7b). We integrate\nthis models with RAG systems, and we explore how variations in temperature\nsettings affect performances. Moreover, we continue our investigation by\nperforming the CVA task utilizing SemanticBERT, analyzing how various metadata\ninformation influence its performance.\n  Initial findings indicate that LLMs generally perform well at temperatures\nbelow 1.0, achieving an accuracy of 100\\% in certain cases. Nevertheless, our\ninvestigation also reveal that the nature of the data significantly influences\nCVA task outcomes. In fact, in cases where the input data and glossary are\nrelated (for example by being created by the same organizations) traditional\nmethods appear to surpass the performance of LLMs.",

This is a\nmajor problem in fields such as medicine where practitioners are reluctant to\nblindly trust black-box models to make important patient decisions.\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were recently proposed as an interpretable\nand accurate alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

However, recent deep learning-based methods generally face two\nsignificant issues: 1) reliance on large-scale pre-trained weights, and 2)\ngeneration of thick edges. We construct a U-shape encoder-decoder model named\nCPD-Net that successfully addresses these two issues simultaneously. In\nresponse to issue 1), we propose a novel cycle pixel difference convolution\n(CPDC), which effectively integrates edge prior knowledge with modern\nconvolution operations, consequently successfully eliminating the dependence on\nlarge-scale pre-trained weights. As for issue 2), we construct a multi-scale\ninformation enhancement module (MSEM) and a dual residual connection-based\n(DRC) decoder to enhance the edge location ability of the model, thereby\ngenerating crisp and clean contour maps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on\nfour standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS=0.813 and AC=0.352), NYUD-V2 (ODS=0.760\nand AC=0.223), BIPED dataset (ODS=0.898 and AC=0.426), and CID (ODS=0.59).

The Adam optimizer has gained significant attention due to its\nefficiency and wide applicability.

In the conventional Adam optimizer, gradients are\nutilized to compute estimates of gradient mean and variance, subsequently\nupdating model parameters. Our approach introduces a learnable distortion\nmatrix, denoted as P, which is employed for linearly transforming gradients.\nThis transformation slightly adjusts gradients during each iteration, enabling\nthe optimizer to better adapt to distinct dataset characteristics. By learning\nan appropriate distortion matrix P, our method aims to adaptively adjust\ngradient information across different data distributions, thereby enhancing\noptimization performance.

This allows training or fine-tuning a\nhuman model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth.\nPredicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging\ndue to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to\nretain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses.

We\nempirically show that multivariate regression, as employed in imitation\nlearning and other applications, exhibits Neural Regression Collapse (NRC), a\nnew form of neural collapse: (NRC1) The last-layer feature vectors collapse to\nthe subspace spanned by the $n$ principal components of the feature vectors,\nwhere $n$ is the dimension of the targets (for univariate regression, $n=1$);\n(NRC2) The last-layer feature vectors also collapse to the subspace spanned by\nthe last-layer weight vectors; (NRC3) The Gram matrix for the weight vectors\nconverges to a specific functional form that depends on the covariance matrix\nof the targets. After empirically establishing the prevalence of (NRC1)-(NRC3)\nfor a variety of datasets and network architectures, we provide an explanation\nof these phenomena by modeling the regression task in the context of the\nUnconstrained Feature Model (UFM), in which the last layer feature vectors are\ntreated as free variables when minimizing the loss function. We show that when\nthe regularization parameters in the UFM model are strictly positive, then\n(NRC1)-(NRC3) also emerge as solutions in the UFM optimization problem. We also\nshow that if the regularization parameters are equal to zero, then there is no\ncollapse.

    "abstract": "Due to the high cost of training, large model (LM) practitioners commonly use\npretrained models downloaded from untrusted sources, which could lead to owning\ncompromised models. In-context learning is the ability of LMs to perform\nmultiple tasks depending on the prompt or context. This can enable new attacks,\nsuch as backdoor attacks with dynamic behavior depending on how models are\nprompted.\n  In this paper, we leverage the ability of vision transformers (ViTs) to\nperform different tasks depending on the prompts. Then, through data poisoning,\nwe investigate two new threats: i) task-specific backdoors where the attacker\nchooses a target task to attack, and only the selected task is compromised at\ntest time under the presence of the trigger. At the same time, any other task\nis not affected, even if prompted with the trigger. We succeeded in attacking\nevery tested model, achieving up to 89.90\\% degradation on the target task. ii)\nWe generalize the attack, allowing the backdoor to affect \\emph{any} task, even\ntasks unseen during the training phase. Our attack was successful on every\ntested model, achieving a maximum of $13\\times$ degradation. Finally, we\ninvestigate the robustness of prompts and fine-tuning as techniques for\nremoving the backdoors from the model. We found that these methods fall short\nand, in the best case, reduce the degradation from 89.90\\% to 73.46\\%.",

However, most existing approaches\nfocus solely on generating code in a single programming language, overlooking\nthe potential of leveraging the multi-language capabilities of LLMs. LLMs have\nvarying patterns of errors across different languages, suggesting that a more\nrobust approach could be developed by leveraging these multi-language outputs.\nIn this study, we propose Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), a novel\nensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming\nlanguages to enhance overall performance. By treating each language-specific\ncode generation process as an individual \"weak expert\" and effectively\nintegrating their outputs, our method mitigates language-specific errors and\nbiases. This multi-language ensemble strategy leverages the complementary\nstrengths of different programming languages, enabling the model to produce\nmore accurate and robust code. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with\ncommonly used techniques such as the reflection algorithm and Monte Carlo tree\nsearch to improve code generation quality further. Experimental results show\nthat our framework consistently enhances baseline performance by up to 17.92%\non existing benchmarks (HumanEval and HumanEval-plus), with a standout result\nof 96.25% accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art\nresults across various LLM models.

Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the\nvery first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the\nentire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design\nthat evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and\nperforms the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and\nan LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel\nideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first\nstatistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research\nideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than\nhuman expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying\nour agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and\nevaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their\nlack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements\nof novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study\ndesign which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects,\nenabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in\nmeaningful differences in research outcome.",

However, most studies\nstruggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks,\nlimiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a\nnovel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by\nutilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask\nlearning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the\nspectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial\npatterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture\nis used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit\ndifferent generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To\naddress this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously\nregulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task\nbased on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six\nbenchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet\nconsistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent\nand -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification\nresults show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering\npromising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as\nlightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.",

Recent advancements in\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in\nthis area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power,\nand high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight,\non-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the\nlack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight\nmodels. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that\nemploys masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data\nthrough self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for\nuser intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal\ndatasets, \"Intent in the Wild\" (IIW) and \"Intent in the Tame\" (IIT), designed\nfor few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos\nacross 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10\ncategories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that\nrepresentations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM\ndecoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of\nstate-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and\ndeployment resources.

However, collecting the training data necessary to create\ngeneric and high-precision models is extremely challenging due to the\ndifficulty of annotation and the diversity of domains. Furthermore, it is\ndifficult to transfer training data across different crops, and although\nmachine learning models effective for specific environments, conditions, or\ncrops have been developed, they cannot be widely applied in actual fields. In\nthis study, we propose a generative data augmentation method (D4) for vineyard\nshoot detection. D4 uses a pre-trained text-guided diffusion model based on a\nlarge number of original images culled from video data collected by unmanned\nground vehicles or other means, and a small number of annotated datasets. The\nproposed method generates new annotated images with background information\nadapted to the target domain while retaining annotation information necessary\nfor object detection. In addition, D4 overcomes the lack of training data in\nagriculture, including the difficulty of annotation and diversity of domains.\nWe confirmed that this generative data augmentation method improved the mean\naverage precision by up to 28.65% for the BBox detection task and the average\nprecision by up to 13.73% for the keypoint detection task for vineyard shoot\ndetection. Our generative data augmentation method D4 is expected to\nsimultaneously solve the cost and domain diversity issues of training data\ngeneration in agriculture and improve the generalization performance of\ndetection models.",

COLUMBUS comprises over 1,000 puzzles, each with four answer\ncandidates. While the SotA vision-language models (VLMs) achieve decent\nperformance, our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between humans and\nmodels. VLMs benefit from human-curated descriptions but struggle to\nself-generate such representations at the right level of abstraction.",

    "abstract": "Running LLMs on end devices has garnered significant attention recently due\nto their advantages in privacy preservation. With the advent of lightweight LLM\nmodels and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the\nnecessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that\nLLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information,\nspecifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to\nreconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant\nvulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\nand Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive\nor resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which\noperates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight\nmatrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime\nphase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of\nthe layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the\nTEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus\npreventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the\ncorrectness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.",

    "abstract": "The detection of fa\\c{c}ade elements on buildings, such as doors, windows,\nbalconies, air conditioning units, billboards, and glass curtain walls, is a\ncritical step in automating the creation of Building Information Modeling\n(BIM). Yet, this field faces significant challenges, including the uneven\ndistribution of fa\\c{c}ade elements, the presence of small objects, and\nsubstantial background noise, which hamper detection accuracy. To address these\nissues, we develop the BFA-YOLO model and the BFA-3D dataset in this study. The\nBFA-YOLO model is an advanced architecture designed specifically for analyzing\nmulti-view images of fa\\c{c}ade attachments. It integrates three novel\ncomponents: the Feature Balanced Spindle Module (FBSM) that tackles the issue\nof uneven object distribution; the Target Dynamic Alignment Task Detection Head\n(TDATH) that enhances the detection of small objects; and the Position Memory\nEnhanced Self-Attention Mechanism (PMESA), aimed at reducing the impact of\nbackground noise. These elements collectively enable BFA-YOLO to effectively\naddress each challenge, thereby improving model robustness and detection\nprecision. The BFA-3D dataset, offers multi-view images with precise\nannotations across a wide range of fa\\c{c}ade attachment categories. This\ndataset is developed to address the limitations present in existing fa\\c{c}ade\ndetection datasets, which often feature a single perspective and insufficient\ncategory coverage. Through comparative analysis, BFA-YOLO demonstrated\nimprovements of 1.8\\% and 2.9\\% in mAP$_{50}$ on the BFA-3D dataset and the\npublic Fa\\c{c}ade-WHU dataset, respectively, when compared to the baseline\nYOLOv8 model.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) classifies human emotions in speech with a\ncomputer model. Recently, performance in SER has steadily increased as deep\nlearning techniques have adapted. However, unlike many domains that use speech\ndata, data for training in the SER model is insufficient. This causes\noverfitting of training of the neural network, resulting in performance\ndegradation. In fact, successful emotion recognition requires an effective\npreprocessing method and a model structure that efficiently uses the number of\nweight parameters. In this study, we propose using eight dataset versions with\ndifferent frequency-time resolutions to search for an effective emotional\nspeech preprocessing method. We propose a 6-layer convolutional neural network\n(CNN) model with efficient channel attention (ECA) to pursue an efficient model\nstructure. In particular, the well-positioned ECA blocks can improve channel\nfeature representation with only a few parameters. With the interactive\nemotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) dataset, increasing the frequency\nresolution in preprocessing emotional speech can improve emotion recognition\nperformance. Also, ECA after the deep convolution layer can effectively\nincrease channel feature representation. Consequently, the best result (79.37UA\n79.68WA) can be obtained, exceeding the performance of previous SER models.\nFurthermore, to compensate for the lack of emotional speech data, we experiment\nwith multiple preprocessing data methods that augment trainable data\npreprocessed with all different settings from one sample. In the experiment, we\ncan achieve the highest result (80.28UA 80.46WA).",

    "abstract": "Automatic Medical Imaging Narrative generation aims to alleviate the workload\nof radiologists by producing accurate clinical descriptions directly from\nradiological images. However, the subtle visual nuances and domain-specific\nterminology in medical images pose significant challenges compared to generic\nimage captioning tasks. Existing approaches often neglect the vital distinction\nbetween normal and abnormal findings, leading to suboptimal performance. In\nthis work, we propose FODA-PG, a novel Fine-grained Organ-Disease Adaptive\nPartitioning Graph framework that addresses these limitations through\ndomain-adaptive learning. FODA-PG constructs a granular graphical\nrepresentation of radiological findings by separating disease-related\nattributes into distinct \"disease-specific\" and \"disease-free\" categories based\non their clinical significance and location. This adaptive partitioning enables\nour model to capture the nuanced differences between normal and pathological\nstates, mitigating the impact of data biases. By integrating this fine-grained\nsemantic knowledge into a powerful transformer-based architecture and providing\nrigorous mathematical justifications for its effectiveness, FODA-PG generates\nprecise and clinically coherent reports with enhanced generalization\ncapabilities. Extensive experiments on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods,\nhighlighting the importance of domain adaptation in medical report generation.",

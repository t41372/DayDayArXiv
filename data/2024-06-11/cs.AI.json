However, these methods typically rely heavily on labeled data, which can\nbe scarce or unreliable, or they rely on assumptions like Boltzmann-distributed\ndata that may not hold true in practice. Here, we present DualBind, a novel\nframework that integrates supervised mean squared error (MSE) with unsupervised\ndenoising score matching (DSM) to accurately learn the binding energy function.\nDualBind not only addresses the limitations of DSM-only models by providing\nmore accurate absolute affinity predictions but also improves generalizability\nand reduces reliance on labeled data compared to MSE-only models. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that DualBind excels in predicting binding\naffinities and can effectively utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to\nenhance performance.",

      "abstract": "Context. The last several years saw the emergence of AI assistants for code -\nmulti-purpose AI-based helpers in software engineering. As they become\nomnipresent in all aspects of software development, it becomes critical to\nunderstand their usage patterns.\n  Objective. We aim to better understand how specifically developers are using\nAI assistants, why they are not using them in certain parts of their\ndevelopment workflow, and what needs to be improved in the future.\n  Methods. In this work, we carried out a large-scale survey aimed at how AI\nassistants are used, focusing on specific software development activities and\nstages. We collected opinions of 481 programmers on five broad activities: (a)\nimplementing new features, (b) writing tests, (c) bug triaging, (d)\nrefactoring, and (e) writing natural-language artifacts, as well as their\nindividual stages.\n  Results. Our results provide a novel comparison of different stages where AI\nassistants are used that is both comprehensive and detailed. It highlights\nspecific activities that developers find less enjoyable and want to delegate to\nan AI assistant, e.g., writing tests and natural-language artifacts. We also\ndetermine more granular stages where AI assistants are used, such as generating\ntests and generating docstrings, as well as less studied parts of the workflow,\nsuch as generating test data. Among the reasons for not using assistants, there\nare general aspects like trust and company policies, as well as more concrete\nissues like the lack of project-size context, which can be the focus of the\nfuture research.\n  Conclusion. The provided analysis highlights stages of software development\nthat developers want to delegate and that are already popular for using AI\nassistants, which can be a good focus for features aimed to help developers\nright now. The main reasons for not using AI assistants can serve as a\nguideline for future work.",

We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a\nwide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor\nby 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials.\nMoreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and\nbug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in\nreal-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain\nhow LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.",

CUPID targets the visual analysis of\ndistributions produced by modern text-to-image generative models, wherein a\nuser can specify a scene via natural language, and the model generates a set of\nimages, each intended to satisfy the user's description. CUPID is designed to\nhelp understand the resulting distribution, using contextual cues to facilitate\nanalysis: objects mentioned in the prompt, novel, synthesized objects not\nexplicitly mentioned, and their potential relationships. Central to CUPID is a\nnovel method for visualizing high-dimensional distributions, wherein\ncontextualized embeddings of objects, those found within images, are mapped to\na low-dimensional space via density-based embeddings. We show how such\nembeddings allows one to discover salient styles of objects within a\ndistribution, as well as identify anomalous, or rare, object styles. Moreover,\nwe introduce conditional density embeddings, whereby conditioning on a given\nobject allows one to compare object dependencies within the distribution. We\nemploy CUPID for analyzing image distributions produced by large-scale\ndiffusion models, where our experimental results offer insights on language\nmisunderstanding from such models and biases in object composition, while also\nproviding an interface for discovery of typical, or rare, synthesized scenes.",

Because only well-resourced\ncorporations can train frontier LLMs, we need robust test-time strategies to\ncontrol such biases. Existing solutions, which instruct the LLM to be fair or\nrobust, rely on the model's implicit understanding of bias. Causality provides\na rich formalism through which we can be explicit about our debiasing\nrequirements. Yet, as we show, a naive application of the standard causal\ndebiasing strategy, counterfactual data augmentation, fails under standard\nassumptions to debias predictions at an individual level at test time. To\naddress this, we develop a stratified notion of debiasing called stratified\ninvariance, which can capture a range of debiasing requirements from population\nlevel to individual level through an additional measurement that stratifies the\npredictions. We present a complete observational test for stratified\ninvariance. Finally, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that guarantees\nstratified invariance at test time under suitable assumptions, together with a\nprompting strategy that encourages stratified invariance in LLMs. We show that\nour prompting strategy, unlike implicit instructions, consistently reduces the\nbias of frontier LLMs across a suite of synthetic and real-world benchmarks\nwithout requiring additional data, finetuning or pre-training.",

Risk\nanalysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a\nrisk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis\nrequires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and\nstandards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly\nsummarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to\nspecific tasks.\n  Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in risk analysis. To our\nknowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis.\n  Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283\nrepresentative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the\nindustrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned\ncounterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and\nthree other human experts to review the models and the former human experts'\nanalysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses.\n  Results and Conclusions. Human experts demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs\nare quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted\nLLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks\nand complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on\nspecific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and\nbase models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can\nleverage LLMs as an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a\ncondensed timeframe.

      "abstract": "Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are frequently used to assess large language\nmodels (LLMs). Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer\ndeemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length. Unfortunately,\nLLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to\ninherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction\nof answers based on these IDs. Previous research has introduced methods to\nreduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test\nsamples and applying to new ones. Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket\nchoice by ''random guessing''. The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but\nthe option is guessed correctly. This situation is especially serious for those\nsmall-scale LLMs. To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting\nfrom MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection\nbias and random guessing issues. However, transitioning causes its own set of\nchallenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating\nthe correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated\nground-truths. This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and\nestablish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions.\nConsequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs'\nperformance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude\n3, Gemini, etc. Our code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.",

      "abstract": "Single-image relighting is a challenging task that involves reasoning about\nthe complex interplay between geometry, materials, and lighting. Many prior\nmethods either support only specific categories of images, such as portraits,\nor require special capture conditions, like using a flashlight. Alternatively,\nsome methods explicitly decompose a scene into intrinsic components, such as\nnormals and BRDFs, which can be inaccurate or under-expressive. In this work,\nwe propose a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural\nGaffer, that takes a single image of any object and can synthesize an accurate,\nhigh-quality relit image under any novel environmental lighting condition,\nsimply by conditioning an image generator on a target environment map, without\nan explicit scene decomposition. Our method builds on a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting dataset, revealing and\nharnessing the inherent understanding of lighting present in the diffusion\nmodel. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and in-the-wild Internet imagery\nand demonstrate its advantages in terms of generalization and accuracy.\nMoreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model enables many\ndownstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object insertion. Our\nmodel can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such as\nrelighting a radiance field.",

As a result, developing principled and automated optimization\nmethods for compound AI systems is one of the most important new challenges.\nNeural networks faced a similar challenge in its early days until\nbackpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making\noptimization turn-key. Inspired by this, we introduce TextGrad, a powerful\nframework performing automatic ``differentiation'' via text. TextGrad\nbackpropagates textual feedback provided by LLMs to improve individual\ncomponents of a compound AI system. In our framework, LLMs provide rich,\ngeneral, natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation\ngraphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular structures. TextGrad follows\nPyTorch's syntax and abstraction and is flexible and easy-to-use. It works\nout-of-the-box for a variety of tasks, where the users only provide the\nobjective function without tuning components or prompts of the framework. We\nshowcase TextGrad's effectiveness and generality across a diverse range of\napplications, from question answering and molecule optimization to radiotherapy\ntreatment planning. Without modifying the framework, TextGrad improves the\nzero-shot accuracy of GPT-4o in Google-Proof Question Answering from $51\\%$ to\n$55\\%$, yields $20\\%$ relative performance gain in optimizing LeetCode-Hard\ncoding problem solutions, improves prompts for reasoning, designs new druglike\nsmall molecules with desirable in silico binding, and designs radiation\noncology treatment plans with high specificity.

Although reviews have been conducted on\nthis topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work detailing the challenges of\ndialogue summarization, unifying the differing understanding of the task, and\naligning proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the\nchallenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based\nabstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing\n1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the\nSemantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in\ndialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker,\nsalience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as\ngraph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies,\nwhich typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. We find that\nwhile some challenges, like language, have seen considerable progress, mainly\ndue to training methods, others, such as comprehension, factuality, and\nsalience, remain difficult and hold significant research opportunities. We\ninvestigate how these approaches are typically assessed, covering the datasets\nfor the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, medical), the established\nautomatic metrics and human evaluation approaches for assessing scores and\nannotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets span across all\nsubdomains. The ROUGE metric is the most used, while human evaluation is\nfrequently reported without sufficient detail on inner-annotator agreement and\nannotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of\nthe recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a\npotential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy\nremains relevant.",

Differentiable economics is a form of AMD that uses deep learning to\nlearn mechanism designs and has enabled strong progress in AMD in recent years.\nNevertheless, a major open problem has been to learn multi-bidder, general, and\nfully strategy-proof (SP) auctions. We introduce GEneral Menu-based NETwork\n(GemNet), which significantly extends the menu-based approach of the\nsingle-bidder RochetNet (D\\\"utting et al., 2024) to the multi-bidder setting.\nThe challenge in achieving SP is to learn bidder-independent menus that are\nfeasible, so that the optimal menu choices for each bidder do not over-allocate\nitems when taken together (we call this menu compatibility). GemNet penalizes\nthe failure of menu compatibility during training, and transforms learned menus\nafter training through price changes, by considering a set of discretized\nbidder values and reasoning about Lipschitz smoothness to guarantee menu\ncompatibility on the entire value space. This approach is general, leaving\ntrained menus that already satisfy menu compatibility undisturbed and reducing\nto RochetNet for a single bidder. Mixed-integer linear programs are used for\nmenu transforms, and through a number of optimizations enabled by deep\nlearning, including adaptive grids and methods to skip menu elements, we scale\nto large auction design problems. GemNet learns auctions with better revenue\nthan affine maximization methods, achieves exact SP whereas previous general\nmulti-bidder methods are approximately SP, and offers greatly enhanced\ninterpretability.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents NgramMarkov, a variant of the Markov constraints. It is\ndedicated to text generation in constraint programming (CP). It involves a set\nof n-grams (i.e., sequence of n words) associated with probabilities given by a\nlarge language model (LLM). It limits the product of the probabilities of the\nn-gram of a sentence. The propagator of this constraint can be seen as an\nextension of the ElementaryMarkov constraint propagator, incorporating the LLM\ndistribution instead of the maximum likelihood estimation of n-grams. It uses a\ngliding threshold, i.e., it rejects n-grams whose local probabilities are too\nlow, to guarantee balanced solutions. It can also be combined with a\n\"look-ahead\" approach to remove n-grams that are very unlikely to lead to\nacceptable sentences for a fixed-length horizon. This idea is based on the\nMDDMarkovProcess constraint propagator, but without explicitly using an MDD\n(Multi-Valued Decision Diagram). The experimental results show that the\ngenerated text is valued in a similar way to the LLM perplexity function. Using\nthis new constraint dramatically reduces the number of candidate sentences\nproduced, improves computation times, and allows larger corpora or smaller\nn-grams to be used. A real-world problem has been solved for the first time\nusing 4-grams instead of 5-grams.",

      "abstract": "In mathematical proof education, there remains a need for interventions that\nhelp students learn to write mathematical proofs. Research has shown that\ntimely feedback can be very helpful to students learning new skills. While for\nmany years natural language processing models have struggled to perform well on\ntasks related to mathematical texts, recent developments in natural language\nprocessing have created the opportunity to complete the task of giving students\ninstant feedback on their mathematical proofs. In this paper, we present a set\nof training methods and models capable of autograding freeform mathematical\nproofs by leveraging existing large language models and other machine learning\ntechniques. The models are trained using proof data collected from four\ndifferent proof by induction problems. We use four different robust large\nlanguage models to compare their performances, and all achieve satisfactory\nperformances to various degrees. Additionally, we recruit human graders to\ngrade the same proofs as the training data, and find that the best grading\nmodel is also more accurate than most human graders. With the development of\nthese grading models, we create and deploy an autograder for proof by induction\nproblems and perform a user study with students. Results from the study shows\nthat students are able to make significant improvements to their proofs using\nthe feedback from the autograder, but students still do not trust the AI\nautograders as much as they trust human graders. Future work can improve on the\nautograder feedback and figure out ways to help students trust AI autograders.",

      "abstract": "Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI\nsystems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the\ndevelopers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for\nevaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting\ninterests lead to the problem of sandbagging, which we define as strategic\nunderperformance on an evaluation. In this paper we assess sandbagging\ncapabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs,\nlike GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous\ncapability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless)\ncapability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a\nsynthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This\nbehaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In\naddition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted or\npassword-locked to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. We have\nmediocre success in password-locking a model to mimic the answers a weaker\nmodel would give. Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are\nvulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of\nevaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the\ndevelopment and deployment of advanced AI systems.",

      "abstract": "Internet memes, channels for humor, social commentary, and cultural\nexpression, are increasingly used to spread toxic messages. Studies on the\ncomputational analyses of toxic memes have significantly grown over the past\nfive years, and the only three surveys on computational toxic meme analysis\ncover only work published until 2022, leading to inconsistent terminology and\nunexplored trends. Our work fills this gap by surveying content-based\ncomputational perspectives on toxic memes, and reviewing key developments until\nearly 2024. Employing the PRISMA methodology, we systematically extend the\npreviously considered papers, achieving a threefold result. First, we survey\n119 new papers, analyzing 158 computational works focused on content-based\ntoxic meme analysis. We identify over 30 datasets used in toxic meme analysis\nand examine their labeling systems. Second, after observing the existence of\nunclear definitions of meme toxicity in computational works, we introduce a new\ntaxonomy for categorizing meme toxicity types. We also note an expansion in\ncomputational tasks beyond the simple binary classification of memes as toxic\nor non-toxic, indicating a shift towards achieving a nuanced comprehension of\ntoxicity. Third, we identify three content-based dimensions of meme toxicity\nunder automatic study: target, intent, and conveyance tactics. We develop a\nframework illustrating the relationships between these dimensions and meme\ntoxicities. The survey analyzes key challenges and recent trends, such as\nenhanced cross-modal reasoning, integrating expert and cultural knowledge, the\ndemand for automatic toxicity explanations, and handling meme toxicity in\nlow-resource languages. Also, it notes the rising use of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and generative AI for detecting and generating toxic memes. Finally, it\nproposes pathways for advancing toxic meme detection and interpretation.",

While DPO offers simplicity, it remains\nunderutilized in state-of-the-art LLMs, suggesting potential limitations. In\nthis work, we revisit DPO, analyzing its theoretical foundations and empirical\nperformance to bridge this gap. We identify three key properties, termed 3D\nproperties, that emerge from DPO's learning process: Drastic drop in rejected\nresponse likelihood, Degradation into response suppression, and Dispersion\neffect on unseen responses. We show that these issues arise from DPO's\noptimization dynamics, where the interaction between chosen and rejected\nresponse gradients leads to instability. Our findings are supported by\nexperiments on both a controlled toy model and real-world LLM tasks, including\nmathematical problem-solving and instruction following. To address these\nchallenges, we propose simple regularization techniques that improve training\nstability and performance. Additionally, we examine how preference data\ndistribution impacts DPO's effectiveness, offering insights into how alignment\nmodels handle out-of-domain (OOD) data. Our work connects these observations to\nbroader research and provides a theoretical explanation for DPO's limitations.\nWe hope these insights will guide future advancements in reward-model-free\npreference learning, bringing it closer to reward-model-based approaches.",

The dataset consists of a local subset with\nquestions pertinent to the Basque culture, and a global subset with questions\nof broader interest. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with local\ncultural knowledge, even as they excel on global topics. However, we show that\ncontinued pre-training in Basque significantly improves the models' performance\non Basque culture, even when queried in English. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst solid evidence of knowledge transfer from a low-resource to a\nhigh-resource language. Our analysis sheds light on the complex interplay\nbetween language and knowledge, and reveals that some prior findings do not\nfully hold when reassessed on local topics.

In contrast, S2TT and TTS have accumulated a\nlarge amount of data and pretrained models, which have not been fully utilized\nin the development of S2ST models. Inspired by this, in this paper, we first\nintroduce a composite S2ST model named ComSpeech, which can seamlessly\nintegrate any pretrained S2TT and TTS models into a direct S2ST model.\nFurthermore, to eliminate the reliance on parallel speech data, we propose a\nnovel training method ComSpeech-ZS that solely utilizes S2TT and TTS data. It\naligns representations in the latent space through contrastive learning,\nenabling the speech synthesis capability learned from the TTS data to\ngeneralize to S2ST in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results on the CVSS\ndataset show that when the parallel speech data is available, ComSpeech\nsurpasses previous two-pass models like UnitY and Translatotron 2 in both\ntranslation quality and decoding speed.

Despite the\nproliferation of open dataset platforms nowadays, data quality issues, such as\ninsufficient documentation, inaccurate annotations, and ethical concerns,\nremain common in datasets widely used in AI. Furthermore, these issues are\noften subtle and difficult to be detected by rule-based scripts, requiring\nexpensive manual identification and verification by dataset users or\nmaintainers. With the increasing capability of large language models (LLMs), it\nis promising to streamline the curation of datasets with LLM agents. In this\nwork, as the initial step towards this goal, we propose a dataset curation\nagent benchmark, DCA-Bench, to measure LLM agents' capability of detecting\nhidden dataset quality issues. Specifically, we collect diverse real-world\ndataset quality issues from eight open dataset platforms as a testbed.\nAdditionally, to establish an automatic pipeline for evaluating the success of\nLLM agents, which requires a nuanced understanding of the agent outputs, we\nimplement a dedicated Evaluator using another LLM agent. We demonstrate that\nthe LLM-based Evaluator empirically aligns well with human evaluation, allowing\nreliable automatic evaluation on the proposed benchmark. We further conduct\nexperiments on several baseline LLM agents on the proposed benchmark and\ndemonstrate the complexity of the task, indicating that applying LLMs to\nreal-world dataset curation still requires further in-depth exploration and\ninnovation.

However, the practical application scenarios of MLLMs are\nintricate, exposing them to potential malicious instructions and thereby posing\nsafety risks. While current benchmarks do incorporate certain safety\nconsiderations, they often lack comprehensive coverage and fail to exhibit the\nnecessary rigor and robustness. For instance, the common practice of employing\nGPT-4V as both the evaluator and a model to be evaluated lacks credibility, as\nit tends to exhibit a bias toward its own responses. In this paper, we present\nMLLMGuard, a multidimensional safety evaluation suite for MLLMs, including a\nbilingual image-text evaluation dataset, inference utilities, and a lightweight\nevaluator. MLLMGuard's assessment comprehensively covers two languages (English\nand Chinese) and five important safety dimensions (Privacy, Bias, Toxicity,\nTruthfulness, and Legality), each with corresponding rich subtasks. Focusing on\nthese dimensions, our evaluation dataset is primarily sourced from platforms\nsuch as social media, and it integrates text-based and image-based red teaming\ntechniques with meticulous annotation by human experts. This can prevent\ninaccurate evaluation caused by data leakage when using open-source datasets\nand ensures the quality and challenging nature of our benchmark.

Building on our previous work exploring the\nrelationship between active inference, well-being, resilience, and\nsustainability, we present a computational model of an agent learning\nsustainable resource management strategies in both static and dynamic\nenvironments. The agent's behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being,\nrepresented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental\ndynamics. In a static environment, the agent learns to consistently consume\nresources to satisfy its needs. In a dynamic environment where resources\ndeplete and replenish based on the agent's actions, the agent adapts its\nbehavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability. This\ndemonstrates how active inference can give rise to sustainable and resilient\nbehaviors in the face of changing environmental conditions.

However, the presence of demographic terms in\ncommonsense knowledge poses a potential risk of compromising the performance of\nNLP models. This study aims to investigate and propose methods for enhancing\nthe performance and effectiveness of a commonsense polarization classifier by\nmitigating the influence of demographic terms.

The first method involves\nreplacing demographic terms with more general ones based on a term hierarchy\nontology, aiming to mitigate the influence of specific terms. To address the\nlimited bias-related information, the second method measures the polarization\nof demographic terms by comparing the changes in the model's predictions when\nthese terms are masked versus unmasked. This method augments commonsense\nsentences containing terms with high polarization values by replacing their\npredicates with synonyms generated by ChatGPT. The third method combines the\ntwo approaches, starting with threshold-based augmentation followed by\nhierarchical generalization. The experiments show that the first method\nincreases the accuracy over the baseline by 2.33%, and the second one by 0.96%\nover standard augmentation methods.

We\nvalidate our dataset with a human study showing that humans barely outperform\nrandom guessing on the task of distinguishing our synthetic comments from real\nones. Further, we verify that our dataset enables meaningful personal attribute\ninference research by showing across 18 state-of-the-art LLMs that our\nsynthetic comments allow us to draw the same conclusions as real-world data.\nCombined, our experimental results, dataset and pipeline form a strong basis\nfor future privacy-preserving research geared towards understanding and\nmitigating inference-based privacy threats that LLMs pose.",

      "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have\nrevealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through\ncollective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons\nenhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of\ncollaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize\ndirected acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration\nnetwork (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically\norchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it\neffectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular\ntopologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling\nlaw--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale,\nwith collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural\nemergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their\nmultidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement,\nthereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image\nclassification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals\ncollected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or\nmagnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices\nmake relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications.\nOn the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease\nof use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has\nnot been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive\ndatasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset\ncomprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the\nImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than\nexisting similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli\nof multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40\nwith fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object\nclassification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used\nmodels show that the best models can achieve object classification with\naccuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around\n64%.

      "abstract": "Quantum Annealing (QA) holds great potential for solving combinatorial\noptimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms\nheavily relies on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical\ngraphs, into the quantum unit processing (QPU) whose topology is in form of a\nlimited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding Problem. Existing\nmethods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when\nconfronted with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor\nembedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition\nalgorithm ensuring solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for\neffective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world instances, we demonstrate that the efficiency of our proposed order\nexploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In details,\nCHARME yields superior solutions compared to fast embedding methods such as\nMinorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach,\nknown for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases.

This enables\nthem to act as intelligent agents interacting with the real world. The recently\nintroduced ToolLLaMA model by Qin et al. [2023] utilizes the depth-first\nsearch-based decision tree (DFSDT) mechanism for multi-step reasoning with\n$16000+$ real-world APIs, effectively enhancing the performance of\ntool-augmented LLMs compared to traditional chain reasoning mechanisms.\nHowever, their approach only employs successful paths from decision trees (also\ncalled inference trees) for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), missing out on the\npotential learning opportunities from failed paths. Inspired by this, we\npropose an inference trajectory optimization framework based on preference\nlearning to address this limitation. We first introduce a novel method for\nconstructing step-wise preference data from tree-like expert trajectories,\nwhich leverages the previously ignored failed explorations in the decision\ntrees.

In this work, we establish MultiTrust, the first comprehensive\nand unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary\naspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Our benchmark\nemploys a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and\ncross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets.\nExtensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored\ntrustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by\nthe multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to\nenhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still\nstruggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to\nmultimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to\ndisclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when\npaired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality\namplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a\nscalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to\nfacilitate future advancements in this important field.

Recent geometry (e.g., box, cone) and probability (e.g.,\nbeta distribution)-based methodologies have effectively addressed complex FOL\nqueries. However, a common challenge across these methods lies in determining\naccurate geometric bounds or probability parameters for these queries. The\nchallenge arises because existing methods rely on linear sequential operations\nwithin their computation graphs, overlooking the logical structure of the query\nand the relation-induced information that can be gleaned from the relations of\nthe query, which we call the context of the query. To address the problem, we\npropose a model-agnostic methodology that enhances the effectiveness of\nexisting multi-hop logical reasoning approaches by fully integrating the\ncontext of the FOL query graph. Our approach distinctively discerns (1) the\nstructural context inherent to the query structure and (2) the relation-induced\ncontext unique to each node in the query graph as delineated in the\ncorresponding knowledge graph. This dual-context paradigm helps nodes within a\nquery graph attain refined internal representations throughout the multi-hop\nreasoning steps.

This study shows that LLMs are vulnerable to changes in the number and\narrangement of options in text classification. Our extensive empirical analyses\nreveal that the key bottleneck arises from ambiguous decision boundaries and\ninherent biases towards specific tokens and positions. To mitigate these\nissues, we make the first attempt and propose a novel two-stage classification\nframework for LLMs. Our approach is grounded in the empirical observation that\npairwise comparisons can effectively alleviate boundary ambiguity and inherent\nbias. Specifically, we begin with a self-reduction technique to efficiently\nnarrow down numerous options, which contributes to reduced decision space and a\nfaster comparison process. Subsequently, pairwise contrastive comparisons are\nemployed in a chain-of-thought manner to draw out nuances and distinguish\nconfusable options, thus refining the ambiguous decision boundary. Extensive\nexperiments on four datasets (Banking77, HWU64, LIU54, and Clinic150) verify\nthe effectiveness of our framework.

Specifically, Tensor Product Representation (TPR) framework\nenables neural networks to perform differentiable symbolic operations by\nencoding the symbolic structure of data within vector spaces.

To\naddress this decomposition problem, we propose a Discrete Dictionary-based\nDecomposition (D3) layer designed to enhance the decomposition capabilities of\nTPR-based models. D3 employs discrete, learnable key-value dictionaries trained\nto capture symbolic features essential for decomposition operations. It\nleverages the prior knowledge acquired during training to generate structured\nTPR representations by mapping input data to pre-learned symbolic features\nwithin these dictionaries. D3 is a straightforward drop-in layer that can be\nseamlessly integrated into any TPR-based model without modifications. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that D3 significantly improves the systematic\ngeneralization of various TPR-based models while requiring fewer additional\nparameters.

      "abstract": "As a sub-field of object detection, moving infrared small target detection\npresents significant challenges due to tiny target sizes and low contrast\nagainst backgrounds. Currently-existing methods primarily rely on the features\nextracted only from spatio-temporal domain. Frequency domain has hardly been\nconcerned yet, although it has been widely applied in image processing. To\nextend feature source domains and enhance feature representation, we propose a\nnew Triple-domain Strategy (Tridos) with the frequency-aware memory enhancement\non spatio-temporal domain for infrared small target detection. In this scheme,\nit effectively detaches and enhances frequency features by a local-global\nfrequency-aware module with Fourier transform. Inspired by human visual system,\nour memory enhancement is designed to capture the spatial relations of infrared\ntargets among video frames. Furthermore, it encodes temporal dynamics motion\nfeatures via differential learning and residual enhancing. Additionally, we\nfurther design a residual compensation to reconcile possible cross-domain\nfeature mismatches. To our best knowledge, proposed Tridos is the first work to\nexplore infrared target feature learning comprehensively in\nspatio-temporal-frequency domains. The extensive experiments on three datasets\n(i.e., DAUB, ITSDT-15K and IRDST) validate that our triple-domain infrared\nfeature learning scheme could often be obviously superior to state-of-the-art\nones.

With the advent of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and their advanced reasoning capabilities, these agents\nare now able to handle more complex or previously unseen tasks. However,\nLLM-based automation techniques in recent literature frequently rely on HTML\nsource code for input or application-specific API calls for actions, limiting\ntheir applicability to specific environments. We propose an LLM-based agent\nthat mimics human behavior in solving computer tasks. It perceives its\nenvironment solely through screenshot images, which are then converted into\ntext for an LLM to process. By leveraging the reasoning capability of the LLM,\nwe eliminate the need for large-scale human demonstration data typically\nrequired for model training. The agent only executes keyboard and mouse\noperations on Graphical User Interface (GUI), removing the need for\npre-provided APIs to function. To further enhance the agent's performance in\nthis setting, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Context-Aware Action\nPlanning (CAAP) prompting, which enables the agent to thoroughly examine the\ntask context from multiple perspectives. Our agent achieves an average success\nrate of 94.5% on MiniWoB++ and an average task score of 62.3 on WebShop,\noutperforming all previous studies of agents that rely solely on screen images.\nThis method demonstrates potential for broader applications, particularly for\ntasks requiring coordination across multiple applications on desktops or\nsmartphones, marking a significant advancement in the field of automation\nagents.

However, their\ntypical multi-step sequential-denoising nature gives rise to high cumulative\nlatency, thereby precluding the possibilities of parallel computation. To\naddress this, we introduce AsyncDiff, a universal and plug-and-play\nacceleration scheme that enables model parallelism across multiple devices. Our\napproach divides the cumbersome noise prediction model into multiple\ncomponents, assigning each to a different device. To break the dependency chain\nbetween these components, it transforms the conventional sequential denoising\ninto an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity between hidden\nstates in consecutive diffusion steps. Consequently, each component is\nfacilitated to compute in parallel on separate devices. The proposed strategy\nsignificantly reduces inference latency while minimally impacting the\ngenerative quality. Specifically, for the Stable Diffusion v2.1, AsyncDiff\nachieves a 2.7x speedup with negligible degradation and a 4.0x speedup with\nonly a slight reduction of 0.38 in CLIP Score, on four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs.

      "abstract": "Food is foundational to human life, serving not only as a source of\nnourishment but also as a cornerstone of cultural identity and social\ninteraction. As the complexity of global dietary needs and preferences grows,\nfood intelligence is needed to enable food perception and reasoning for various\ntasks, ranging from recipe generation and dietary recommendation to\ndiet-disease correlation discovery and understanding. Towards this goal, for\npowerful capabilities across various domains and tasks in Large Language Models\n(LLMs), we introduce Food-oriented LLM FoodSky to comprehend food data through\nperception and reasoning. Considering the complexity and typicality of Chinese\ncuisine, we first construct one comprehensive Chinese food corpus FoodEarth\nfrom various authoritative sources, which can be leveraged by FoodSky to\nachieve deep understanding of food-related data. We then propose Topic-based\nSelective State Space Model (TS3M) and the Hierarchical Topic Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (HTRAG) mechanism to enhance FoodSky in capturing\nfine-grained food semantics and generating context-aware food-relevant text,\nrespectively. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FoodSky significantly\noutperforms general-purpose LLMs in both chef and dietetic examinations, with\nan accuracy of 67.2% and 66.4% on the Chinese National Chef Exam and the\nNational Dietetic Exam, respectively. FoodSky not only promises to enhance\nculinary creativity and promote healthier eating patterns, but also sets a new\nstandard for domain-specific LLMs that address complex real-world issues in the\nfood domain. An online demonstration of FoodSky is available at\nhttp://222.92.101.211:8200.",

      "abstract": "Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building\ncontemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches\nsuch as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task\ninto successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling\n(RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning\ntask. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant\nunder-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward\nmodel and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment\nperformance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated\nHuman Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and\ndemonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach\nadmits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and\nleverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy\nOptimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment\npipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with\nextensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control\nproblems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the\nexisting alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially\nwhen the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.",

We suggest that LLMs do develop a kind of empirical\n\"understanding\" that is \"geometry\"-like, which seems adequate for a range of\napplications in NLP, computer vision, coding assistance, etc. However, this\n\"geometric\" understanding, built from incomplete and noisy data, makes them\nunreliable, difficult to generalize, and lacking in inference capabilities and\nexplanations, similar to the challenges faced by heuristics-based expert\nsystems decades ago.\n  To overcome these limitations, we suggest that LLMs should be integrated with\nan \"algebraic\" representation of knowledge that includes symbolic AI elements\nused in expert systems.

Although, the potential benefits of\nLLM-generated code are vast, most notably in efficiency and rapid prototyping,\nas LLMs become increasingly integrated into the software development lifecycle\nand hence the supply chain, complex and multifaceted challenges arise as the\ncode generated from these language models carry profound questions on quality\nand correctness. Research is required to comprehensively explore these critical\nconcerns surrounding LLM-generated code.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel solution called metamorphic prompt testing\nto address these challenges. Our intuitive observation is that intrinsic\nconsistency always exists among correct code pieces but may not exist among\nflawed code pieces, so we can detect flaws in the code by detecting\ninconsistencies. Therefore, we can vary a given prompt to multiple prompts with\nparaphrasing, and to ask the LLM to acquire multiple versions of generated\ncode, so that we can validate whether the semantic relations still hold in the\nacquired code through cross-validation. Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that\nmetamorphic prompt testing is able to detect 75 percent of the erroneous\nprograms generated by GPT-4, with a false positive rate of 8.6 percent.",

Existing work in bandits has shown that it is possible to identify\nthe best policy by estimating only the difference between the behaviors of\nindividual policies, which can be substantially cheaper than estimating the\nbehavior of each policy directly. However, the best-known complexities in RL\nfail to take advantage of this and instead estimate the behavior of each policy\ndirectly. Does it suffice to estimate only the differences in the behaviors of\npolicies in RL? We answer this question positively for contextual bandits but\nin the negative for tabular RL, showing a separation between contextual bandits\nand RL. However, inspired by this, we show that it almost suffices to estimate\nonly the differences in RL: if we can estimate the behavior of a single\nreference policy, it suffices to only estimate how any other policy deviates\nfrom this reference policy. We develop an algorithm which instantiates this\nprinciple and obtains, to the best of our knowledge, the tightest known bound\non the sample complexity of tabular RL.",

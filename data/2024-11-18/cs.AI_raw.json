    "abstract": "This study examines conversational business analytics, an approach that\nutilizes AI to address the technical competency gaps that hinder end users from\neffectively using traditional self-service analytics. By facilitating natural\nlanguage interactions, conversational business analytics aims to empower end\nusers to independently retrieve data and generate insights. The analysis\nfocuses on Text-to-SQL as a representative technology for translating natural\nlanguage requests into SQL statements. Developing theoretical models grounded\nin expected utility theory, this study identifies the conditions under which\nconversational business analytics, through partial or full support, can\noutperform delegation to human experts. The results indicate that partial\nsupport, focusing solely on information generation by AI, is viable when the\naccuracy of AI-generated SQL queries leads to a profit that surpasses the\nperformance of a human expert. In contrast, full support includes not only\ninformation generation but also validation through explanations provided by the\nAI, and requires sufficiently high validation effectiveness to be reliable.\nHowever, user-based validation presents challenges, such as misjudgment and\nrejection of valid SQL queries, which may limit the effectiveness of\nconversational business analytics. These challenges underscore the need for\nrobust validation mechanisms, including improved user support, automated\nprocesses, and methods for assessing quality independent of the technical\ncompetency of end users.",

To address this limitation, we propose a\nHierarchical Diffusion Classifier (HDC) that exploits hierarchical label\nstructures or well-defined parent-child relationships in the dataset. By\npruning irrelevant high-level categories and refining predictions only within\nrelevant subcategories (leaf nodes and sub-trees), HDC reduces the total number\nof class evaluations. As a result, HDC can speed up inference by as much as 60%\nwhile preserving and sometimes even improving classification accuracy.

Conversely, deep learning\nbased listwise methods, while aiming to optimise entire lists, require complex\ntuning and yield only marginal improvements over robust pairwise models. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce Travelling Salesman Problem Rank\n(TSPRank), a hybrid pairwise-listwise ranking method. TSPRank reframes the\nranking problem as a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known\ncombinatorial optimisation challenge that has been extensively studied for its\nnumerous solution algorithms and applications. This approach enables the\nmodelling of pairwise relationships and leverages combinatorial optimisation to\ndetermine the listwise ranking. This approach can be directly integrated as an\nadditional component into embeddings generated by existing backbone models to\nenhance ranking performance. Our extensive experiments across three backbone\nmodels on diverse tasks, including stock ranking, information retrieval, and\nhistorical events ordering, demonstrate that TSPRank significantly outperforms\nboth pure pairwise and listwise methods. Our qualitative analysis reveals that\nTSPRank's main advantage over existing methods is its ability to harness global\ninformation better while ranking.

Adding to that, we are also putting focus on creating a\nframework that can also convert text into sign language in real time which can\nhelp us break the language barrier for the people who are in need.

The CNN model here is also run in real\ntime for sign language detection. We have introduced a novel method for\nconverting text based input to sign language by making a framework that will\ntake a sentence as input, identify keywords from that sentence and then show a\nvideo where sign language is performed with respect to the sentence given as\ninput in real time.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in areas influencing\nsocietal outcomes, it is critical to understand their tendency to perpetuate\nand amplify biases. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit biases in\npredicting human mobility -- a fundamental human behavior -- based on race and\ngender. Using three prominent LLMs -- GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude -- we analyzed\ntheir predictions of visitations to points of interest (POIs) for individuals,\nrelying on prompts that included names with and without explicit demographic\ndetails. We find that LLMs frequently reflect and amplify existing societal\nbiases. Specifically, predictions for minority groups were disproportionately\nskewed, with these individuals being significantly less likely to be associated\nwith wealth-related points of interest (POIs). Gender biases were also evident,\nas female individuals were consistently linked to fewer career-related POIs\ncompared to their male counterparts. These biased associations suggest that\nLLMs not only mirror but also exacerbate societal stereotypes, particularly in\ncontexts involving race and gender.",

This approach not\nonly preserves the effectiveness of training but also offers enhanced\nbiological interpretability. The foundation of this methodology lies in the\nsystem's reversibility, which stems from its inherent symmetry,a key aspect of\nour research. However, this method alone is insufficient for effective neural\nnetwork training. To address this, we further introduce a distributed\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control approach, emphasizing its\nimplementation within a closed system. By incorporating this method, we\nachieved both faster training speeds and improved accuracy.

Recognizing forgeries of\nfacial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges. For example,\nfactors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different\nangles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and\nperspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult.\nDespite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of\nforgery detection. Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.\n  This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using\nFake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard) [10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces [61] data sets.\nBoth data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images.\nIn our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct\nforgery detection using these images. Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN\narchitectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with\nnewly developed lightweight CNN models. It's shown that the proposed\nlightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers.

Finally, a\ndiffusion-based video transition generation model interpolates disease\nprogression between these states. We validate our framework across three\nmedical imaging domains: chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image. Our\nresults demonstrate that MVG significantly outperforms baseline models in\ngenerating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories. Two user\nstudies by veteran physicians, provide further validation and insights into the\nclinical utility of the generated sequences.

Transformer-based\nmodels, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training\nand fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use.\nMoreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored.

In terms of occupancy, the resulting data\nflow can be very sparse reaching $10^{-3}$ for proton-proton collisions. Such\nsparsity presents a challenge to conventional learning-free lossy compression\nalgorithms, such as SZ, ZFP, and MGARD. In contrast, emerging deep\nlearning-based models, particularly those utilizing convolutional neural\nnetworks for compression, have outperformed these conventional methods in terms\nof compression ratios and reconstruction accuracy. However, research on the\nefficacy of these deep learning models in handling sparse datasets, like those\nproduced in particle colliders, remains limited. Furthermore, most deep\nlearning models do not adapt their processing speeds to data sparsity, which\naffects efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for TPC\ndata compression via key-point identification facilitated by sparse\nconvolution. Our proposed algorithm, BCAE-VS, achieves a $75\\%$ improvement in\nreconstruction accuracy with a $10\\%$ increase in compression ratio over the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. Additionally, BCAE-VS manages to achieve these\nresults with a model size over two orders of magnitude smaller. Lastly, we have\nexperimentally verified that as sparsity increases, so does the model's\nthroughput.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models,\nmany recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information\nfor user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a\ncascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide\nomnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream\nrecommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input\nto fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable\nimprovements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model\nperformance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model\nis always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation\nmodels are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two\nfundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a\nlack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation\nUnlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in\ncache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could\nnot be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for\ndownstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream\ntasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the\nspecialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream\nmodels.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs,\nwhich endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic\nunderstanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by\nconstructing a \"task graph\" and a \"scene graph\" to represent task and scene\nsemantic information, respectively. We introduce a \"state graph\" to facilitate\ninteraction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information.\nFurthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational\nskills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and\nchain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging\nlarge language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to\nachieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive\ntrajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill\nlibrary, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical\nlevel, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception\nmethod based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains\nhigh-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data\nand adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to\nensure effectiveness in new environments.

To address this, we\npropose \\textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic\nbackdoor attack in the physical world.

Our vanilla\nimplementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor\nmodule. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a\nprime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing\nthree types of prime attacks, \\ie, \\textit{permutation}, \\textit{stagnation},\nand \\textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors.\nExtensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using\nrobotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and\nphysical-world stealth of TrojanRobot.

    "abstract": "6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while\nbringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative\nAI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN\n(ORAN) and Network-in-a-Box strongly advocate the use of low-cost,\noff-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, e.g., in\nprovisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture,\nhardware testbeds and precise performance quantification of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) on off-the-shelf edge devices remains largely unexplored. This\nresearch investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single\ncommodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate\nvarious LLMs, including small, medium and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5\nCluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular\nprompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing\nthroughput, latency, accuracy and efficiency. Our findings indicate that\nCPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can\neffectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5\nto 12 tokens per second with less than 50\\% CPU and RAM usage. We conclude that\nGenAI on the edge offers localized inference in remote or bandwidth-constrained\nenvironments in 6G networks without reliance on cloud infrastructure.",

We claim that the effectiveness of process supervision significantly\ndepends on both the accuracy and the length of reasoning chains. Moreover, we\nidentify that these factors exhibit a nonlinear relationship with the overall\nreward score of the reasoning process. Inspired by these insights, we propose a\nnovel process supervision paradigm, PSPO*, which systematically outlines the\nworkflow from reward model training to policy optimization, and highlights the\nimportance of nonlinear rewards in process supervision. Based on PSPO*, we\ndevelop the PSPO-WRS, which considers the number of reasoning steps in\ndetermining reward scores and utilizes an adjusted Weibull distribution for\nnonlinear reward shaping. Experimental results on six mathematical reasoning\ndatasets demonstrate that PSPO-WRS consistently outperforms current mainstream\nmodels.",

The investigation begins with Olivaw, an AlphaGo\nZero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is unable to\ncommunicate it. This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory\nLearning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist\nwhen trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL\nprescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a popular board game simulating the\nscientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an\nartificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used\nto explain its findings, and not rely on a rigid existing interpreter.\nQuestioning the very process of learning an interpreter, we turn our attention\nto the inner functioning of modern multimodal models. This culminates in a\nsimple idea to build CLIP-like models where interpretation and perception are\nexplicitly disentangled: a cost-effective approach that couples two unimodal\nmodels using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we\ndiscuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial\nscientists, and introduce the Big-Bench Symbol Interpretation Task, a benchmark\nabout interpreting Zendo-like explanations that sees LLMs going no further than\nrandom chance while being instead fully solved by humans.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning, commonly applied in large-scale multimodal models,\noften relies on data from diverse and often unreliable sources, which can\ninclude misaligned or mislabeled text-image pairs. This frequently leads to\nrobustness issues and hallucinations, ultimately causing performance\ndegradation. Data valuation is an efficient way to detect and trace these\nmisalignments. Nevertheless, existing methods are computationally expensive for\nlarge-scale models. Although computationally efficient, classical influence\nfunctions are inadequate for contrastive learning models, as they were\ninitially designed for pointwise loss. Furthermore, contrastive learning\ninvolves minimizing the distance between positive sample modalities while\nmaximizing the distance between negative sample modalities. This necessitates\nevaluating the influence of samples from both perspectives. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce the Extended Influence Function for Contrastive Loss\n(ECIF), an influence function crafted for contrastive loss. ECIF considers both\npositive and negative samples and provides a closed-form approximation of\ncontrastive learning models, eliminating the need for retraining. Building upon\nECIF, we develop a series of algorithms for data evaluation, misalignment\ndetection, and misprediction trace-back tasks.

However, they either require a trusted central agent\nor incur a significantly higher privacy cost, making it unsuitable for many\nscenarios.

The reconstruction-based methods\nare the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via\nunsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data\nmay cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous\ndata, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper,\nwe propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural\nrepresentation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge.\nDue to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency\nsignals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data.\nSpecifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous\nfunction and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of\ngiven data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of\ncapturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous\nanomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous\nfunction to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a\npre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in\nanomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior\noverall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly\ndetection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based medical image segmentation helps assist diagnosis and\naccelerate the treatment process while the model training usually requires\nlarge-scale dense annotation datasets. Weakly semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation is an essential application because it only requires a small\namount of scribbles and a large number of unlabeled data to train the model,\nwhich greatly reduces the clinician's effort to fully annotate images. To\nhandle the inadequate supervisory information challenge in weakly\nsemi-supervised segmentation (WSSS), a SuperPixel-Propagated Pseudo-label\n(SP${}^3$) learning method is proposed, using the structural information\ncontained in superpixel for supplemental information. Specifically, the\nannotation of scribbles is propagated to superpixels and thus obtains a dense\nannotation for supervised training. Since the quality of pseudo-labels is\nlimited by the low-quality annotation, the beneficial superpixels selected by\ndynamic thresholding are used to refine pseudo-labels. Furthermore, aiming to\nalleviate the negative impact of noise in pseudo-label, superpixel-level\nuncertainty is incorporated to guide the pseudo-label supervision for stable\nlearning. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tumor and\norgan segmentation datasets under the WSSS setting, using only 3\\% of the\nannotation workload compared to fully supervised methods and attaining\napproximately 80\\% Dice score. Additionally, our method outperforms eight\nweakly and semi-supervised methods under both weakly supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings.

    "abstract": "Although substantial efforts have been made to mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting in continual learning, the intrinsic mechanisms are not well\nunderstood. In this paper, we discover that when a forgetting model passively\nreceives an externally provided partial appropriate rationale, its performance\non the forgotten task can be restored. Furthermore, by simply adding a\ntask-agnostic prefix to the original instruction, the forgetting model can\nactively generate an appropriate rationale to reach the correct answer. These\nfindings suggest that the model does not actually ``forget'' the task\nknowledge; instead, the degraded performance can be attributed to the failure\nof the original instructions in guiding the model to generate the appropriate\nrationales. Based on this insight, we propose the Rationale-Guidance Difficulty\nmetric to evaluate how effectively a given instruction guides the model in\ngenerating appropriate rationales. We apply this metric to optimize the\nallocation of replay data in replay-based continual learning algorithm.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our data allocation method effectively\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains better model plasticity\nsimultaneously across models.",

    "abstract": "Online shopping platforms, such as Amazon and AliExpress, are increasingly\nprevalent in society, helping customers purchase products conveniently. With\nrecent progress in natural language processing, researchers and practitioners\nshift their focus from traditional product search to conversational product\nsearch. Conversational product search enables user-machine conversations and\nthrough them collects explicit user feedback that allows to actively clarify\nthe users' product preferences. Therefore, prospective research on an\nintelligent shopping assistant via conversations is indispensable. Existing\npublications on conversational product search either model conversations\nindependently from users, queries, and products or lead to a vocabulary\nmismatch. In this work, we propose a new conversational product search model,\nConvPS, to assist users in locating desirable items. The model is first trained\nto jointly learn the semantic representations of user, query, item, and\nconversation via a unified generative framework. After learning these\nrepresentations, they are integrated to retrieve the target items in the latent\nsemantic space. Meanwhile, we propose a set of greedy and explore-exploit\nstrategies to learn to ask the user a sequence of high-performance questions\nfor conversations. Our proposed ConvPS model can naturally integrate the\nrepresentation learning of the user, query, item, and conversation into a\nunified generative framework, which provides a promising avenue for\nconstructing accurate and robust conversational product search systems that are\nflexible and adaptive. Experimental results demonstrate that our ConvPS model\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Hosting diverse large language model workloads in a unified resource pool\nthrough co-location is cost-effective. For example, long-running chat services\ngenerally follow diurnal traffic patterns, which inspire co-location of batch\njobs to fulfill resource valleys between successive peaks, and thus to saturate\nresource allocation in cluster-wide scope. These heterogeneous workloads often\nhave different business priorities, and therefore preemption can be leveraged\nfor resource elasticity. However, workloads often have distinct topology\npreferences as well. The resources released by lower-priority instances may\nfail to meet the requirements of high-priority online services which are\nusually latency-sensitive. The root cause behind such mis-match is a lack of\ntopology awareness of resource scheduler, especially during preemption. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a fine-grained topology-aware method for preemptive\nscheduling of hybrid workloads. The method ensures that the resources freed by\npreempted tasks adhere to the topological affinity needs of high-priority\npreemptors in a guaranteed or best-effort manner. This dynamic alignment\nsignificantly increases the efficiency of preemption and improves overall\nscheduled performance for LLM workloads by $55\\%$.",

Existing\nexercise recognition approaches often rely on synthetic datasets, raw\ncoordinate inputs sensitive to user and camera variations, and fail to fully\nexploit the temporal dependencies in exercise movements. These issues limit\ntheir generalizability and robustness in real-world conditions, where lighting,\ncamera angles, and user body types vary.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a BiLSTM-based model that leverages\ninvariant features, such as joint angles, alongside raw coordinates. By using\nboth angles and (x, y, z) coordinates, the model adapts to changes in\nperspective, user positioning, and body differences, improving generalization.\nTraining on 30-frame sequences enables the BiLSTM to capture the temporal\ncontext of exercises and recognize patterns evolving over time.\n  We compiled a dataset combining synthetic data from the InfiniteRep dataset\nand real-world videos from Kaggle and other sources. This dataset includes four\ncommon exercises: squat, push-up, shoulder press, and bicep curl. The model was\ntrained and validated on these diverse datasets, achieving an accuracy of over\n99% on the test set. To assess generalizability, the model was tested on 2\nseparate test sets representative of typical usage conditions. Comparisons with\nthe previous approach from the literature are present in the result section\nshowing that the proposed model is the best-performing one.\n  The classifier is integrated into a web application providing real-time\nexercise classification and repetition counting without manual exercise\nselection.\n  Demo and datasets are available at the following GitHub Repository:\nhttps://github.com/RiccardoRiccio/Fitness-AI-Trainer-With-Automatic-Exercise-Recognition-and-Counting.",

The perception model extracts discrete\n(latent) states from continuous observations using a variational Gaussian\nmixture likelihood. Importantly, our model constantly monitors the collected\ndata searching for new Gaussian components, i.e., the perception model performs\na form of structure learning (Smith et al., 2020; Friston et al., 2018; Neacsu\net al., 2022) as it learns the number of Gaussian components in the mixture.\nAdditionally, the transition model learns the temporal transition between\nconsecutive time steps by taking advantage of the Dirichlet-categorical\nconjugacy. Both the perception and transition models are able to forget part of\nthe data points, while integrating the information they provide within the\nprior, which ensure fast variational inference. Finally, decision making is\nperformed with a variant of Q-learning which is able to learn Q-values from\nbeliefs over states. Empirically, we have demonstrated the model's ability to\nlearn the structure of several mazes: the model discovered the number of states\nand the transition probabilities between these states.

The system\nmodels and deliberately counteracts human availability bias, the tendency to\nrely on immediately accessible examples, to discover novel artistic\ncombinations.\n  This system not only produces combinations that have never been attempted\nbefore within our dataset but also identifies and generates combinations that\nare cognitively unavailable to all artists in the domain. Furthermore, we\ntranslate these combinations into visual representations, enabling the\nexploration of subjective perceptions of novelty.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical\nreasoning by incorporating the ability of ``slow thinking\" into multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs). Contrary to existing methods that rely on direct\nor fast thinking, our key idea is to construct long chains of thought (CoT)\nconsisting of atomic actions in a step-by-step manner, guiding MLLMs to perform\ncomplex reasoning. To this end, we design a novel AtomThink framework composed\nof three key modules: (i) a CoT annotation engine that automatically generates\nhigh-quality CoT annotations to address the lack of high-quality visual\nmathematical data; (ii) an atomic step fine-tuning strategy that jointly\noptimizes an MLLM and a policy reward model (PRM) for step-wise reasoning; and\n(iii) four different search strategies that can be applied with the PRM to\ncomplete reasoning. Additionally, we propose AtomMATH, a large-scale multimodal\ndataset of long CoTs, and an atomic capability evaluation metric for\nmathematical tasks. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed\nAtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving\napproximately 50\\% relative accuracy gains on MathVista and 120\\% on MathVerse.\nTo support the advancement of multimodal slow-thinking models, we will make our\ncode and dataset publicly available on https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.",

    "abstract": "High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken\ndown into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these\nearly warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each\nprecursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final\nhigh-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and\ntrack capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones\n(a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that\nenables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety\nCommitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with\ntrusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII).\nBuilding on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for\nspecifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory\ncapabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal\nevaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the\ntrusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory\ncomponents. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection\ninfrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory\ncapabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if\nnecessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking\nit as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical\nregion may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more\ncomprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange\ninformation on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the\nexisting frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons\nlearned from other regulated high-risk sectors.",

The generalization capability of\nST-GNNs in extended temporal scenarios and cross-city applications remains\nlargely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art models on an\nextended traffic benchmark and observe substantial performance degradation in\nexisting ST-GNNs over time, which we attribute to their limited inductive\ncapabilities.

We introduce Internal Consistency Regularization\n(CROW), a novel defense using consistency regularization finetuning to address\nlayer-wise inconsistencies caused by backdoor triggers. CROW leverages the\nintuition that clean models exhibit smooth, consistent transitions in hidden\nrepresentations across layers, whereas backdoored models show noticeable\nfluctuation when triggered.

A review of contemporary research methodologies follows, in\nwhich their respective efficacies, limitations, and applicability to the\ncomplex nature of oracle characters are critically highlighted and examined.\nAdditionally, our review extends to ancillary tasks associated with OrCR across\ndiverse disciplines, providing a broad-spectrum analysis of its applications.\nWe conclude with a forward-looking perspective, proposing potential avenues for\nfuture investigations that could yield significant advancements in the field.",

Although computer-aided diagnostic\nsystems have shown considerable value in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, the\nproblem of multi-classification under sample imbalance remains an intractable\nchallenge. To address this, we propose learning fine-grained information by\ngenerating sub-bags with feature distributions similar to the original WSIs.\nAdditionally, we utilize a pseudo-bag generation algorithm to further leverage\nthe abundant and redundant information in WSIs, allowing efficient training in\nunbalanced-sample multi-classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an\naffinity-based sample selection and curriculum contrastive learning strategy to\nenhance the stability of model representation learning. Unlike previous\napproaches, our framework transitions from learning bag-level representations\nto understanding and exploiting the feature distribution of multi-instance\nbags. Our method demonstrates significant performance improvements on three\ndatasets, including tumor classification and lymph node metastasis.

We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and\nspec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5],\nJESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong\nvalue of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting\nrank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern\nbetween target and candidate molecules.

While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity\nin activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as\nredundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational\noverhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited,\nwith findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study\naims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into\nredundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental\nanalysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy\nacross diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a\nsingle model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of\nvariations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the\nlack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed\nfor a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others.

    "abstract": "In heliophysics research, predicting solar flares is crucial due to their\npotential to impact both space-based systems and Earth's infrastructure\nsubstantially. Magnetic field data from solar active regions, recorded by solar\nimaging observatories, are transformed into multivariate time series to enable\nsolar flare prediction using temporal window-based analysis. In the realm of\nmultivariate time series-driven solar flare prediction, addressing severe class\nimbalance with effective strategies for multivariate time series representation\nlearning is key to developing robust predictive models. Traditional methods\noften struggle with overfitting to the majority class in prediction tasks where\nmajor solar flares are infrequent. This work presents EXCON, a contrastive\nrepresentation learning framework designed to enhance classification\nperformance amidst such imbalances. EXCON operates through four stages:\nobtaining core features from multivariate time series data; selecting\ndistinctive contrastive representations for each class to maximize inter-class\nseparation; training a temporal feature embedding module with a custom extreme\nreconstruction loss to minimize intra-class variation; and applying a\nclassifier to the learned embeddings for robust classification. The proposed\nmethod leverages contrastive learning principles to map similar instances\ncloser in the feature space while distancing dissimilar ones, a strategy not\nextensively explored in solar flare prediction tasks. This approach not only\naddresses class imbalance but also offers a versatile solution applicable to\nunivariate and multivariate time series across binary and multiclass\nclassification problems. Experimental results, including evaluations on the\nbenchmark solar flare dataset and multiple time series archive datasets with\nbinary and multiclass labels, demonstrate EXCON's efficacy in enhancing\nclassification performance.",

The MoE architecture, renowned for its ability to increase model\ncapacity without a proportional increase in inference cost, greatly reduces the\ntoken generation latency compared with dense models. However, the large model\nsize makes MoE models inaccessible to individuals without high-end GPUs. In\nthis paper, we propose a high-throughput MoE batch inference system, that\nsignificantly outperforms past work. MoE-Lightning introduces a novel\nCPU-GPU-I/O pipelining schedule, CGOPipe, with paged weights to achieve high\nresource utilization, and a performance model, HRM, based on a Hierarchical\nRoofline Model we introduce to help find policies with higher throughput than\nexisting systems. MoE-Lightning can achieve up to 10.3x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art offloading-enabled LLM inference systems for Mixtral 8x7B on a\nsingle T4 GPU (16GB). When the theoretical system throughput is bounded by the\nGPU memory, MoE-Lightning can reach the throughput upper bound with 2-3x less\nCPU memory, significantly increasing resource utilization. MoE-Lightning also\nsupports efficient batch inference for much larger MoEs (e.g., Mixtral 8x22B\nand DBRX) on multiple low-cost GPUs (e.g., 2-4 T4).",

Our analysis provides recommendations to address these\nethical challenges, emphasizing the need for fairness in algorithm design,\ntransparency in model decision-making, and patient-centered approaches to\nconsent and data privacy. By highlighting the importance of continuous ethical\nscrutiny and collaboration between AI developers, clinicians, and ethicists, we\noutline pathways for achieving more responsible and inclusive AI implementation\nin healthcare. These strategies, if adopted, could enhance both the clinical\nvalue of AI and the trustworthiness of AI systems among patients and healthcare\nprofessionals, ensuring that these technologies serve all populations\nequitably.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of two objective functions, Mean\nSquared Error (MSE) and Softmax Cross-Entropy (SCE) for neural network\nclassification tasks. While SCE combined with softmax activation is the\nconventional choice for transforming network outputs into class probabilities,\nwe explore an alternative approach using MSE with sigmoid activation. We\nintroduce the Output Reset algorithm, which reduces inconsistent errors and\nenhances classifier robustness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST), we demonstrate that MSE with\nsigmoid activation achieves comparable accuracy and convergence rates to SCE,\nwhile exhibiting superior performance in scenarios with noisy data. Our\nfindings indicate that MSE, despite its traditional association with regression\ntasks, serves as a viable alternative for classification problems, challenging\nconventional wisdom about neural network training strategies.",

    "abstract": "Effective toxic content detection relies heavily on high-quality and diverse\ndata, which serve as the foundation for robust content moderation models.\nSynthetic data has become a common approach for training models across various\nNLP tasks. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain for highly subjective\ntasks like hate speech detection, with previous research yielding mixed\nresults. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data\nsynthesis, utilizing controlled prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques\nto enhance data quality and diversity. We systematically evaluated 6 open\nsource LLMs on 5 datasets, assessing their ability to generate diverse,\nhigh-quality harmful data while minimizing hallucination and duplication. Our\nresults show that Mistral consistently outperforms other open models, and\nsupervised fine-tuning significantly enhances data reliability and diversity.\nWe further analyze the trade-offs between prompt-based vs. fine-tuned toxic\ndata synthesis, discuss real-world deployment challenges, and highlight ethical\nconsiderations. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned open source LLMs\nprovide scalable and cost-effective solutions to augment toxic content\ndetection datasets, paving the way for more accessible and transparent content\nmoderation tools.",

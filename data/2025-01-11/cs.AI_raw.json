    "abstract": "Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language\nmodels (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM\nas a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference\npairs. However, recent work~\\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that\nDPO training \\textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite\nits gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant\nthat instead \\textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes\nenhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank\ncorrectly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this\nby adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment\ndemonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks\nlike Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B.\nAdditionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct\nand incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years,\nyet it continues to struggle with a fundamental aspect of cognition present in\nall animals: common sense. Current AI systems, including those designed for\ncomplex tasks like autonomous driving, problem-solving challenges such as the\nAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and conversational benchmarks like the\nTuring Test, often lack the ability to adapt to new situations without\nextensive prior knowledge. This manuscript argues that integrating common sense\ninto AI systems is essential for achieving true autonomy and unlocking the full\nsocietal and commercial value of AI.\n  We propose a shift in the order of knowledge acquisition emphasizing the\nimportance of developing AI systems that start from minimal prior knowledge and\nare capable of contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment -- even\nwithin abstract domains. Additionally, we highlight the need to rethink the AI\nsoftware stack to address this foundational challenge. Without common sense, AI\nsystems may never reach true autonomy, instead exhibiting asymptotic\nperformance that approaches theoretical ideals like AIXI but remains\nunattainable in practice due to infinite resource and computation requirements.\n  While scaling AI models and passing benchmarks like the Turing Test have\nbrought significant advancements in applications that do not require autonomy,\nthese approaches alone are insufficient to achieve autonomous AI with common\nsense. By redefining existing benchmarks and challenges to enforce constraints\nthat require genuine common sense, and by broadening our understanding of\nembodiment to include both physical and abstract domains, we can encourage the\ndevelopment of AI systems better equipped to handle the complexities of\nreal-world and abstract environments.",

To address these\nchallenges, we present ChemAgent, a novel framework designed to improve the\nperformance of LLMs through a dynamic, self-updating library. This library is\ndeveloped by decomposing chemical tasks into sub-tasks and compiling these\nsub-tasks into a structured collection that can be referenced for future\nqueries.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) approach to\naddress the agent grouping or pairing problem in cooperative multi-agent\nsystems. The goal is to simultaneously learn the optimal grouping and agent\npolicy. By employing a hierarchical RL framework, we distinguish between\nhigh-level decisions of grouping and low-level agents' actions. Our approach\nutilizes the CTDE (Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution) paradigm,\nensuring efficient learning and scalable execution. We incorporate\npermutation-invariant neural networks to handle the homogeneity and cooperation\namong agents, enabling effective coordination. The option-critic algorithm is\nadapted to manage the hierarchical decision-making process, allowing for\ndynamic and optimal policy adjustments.",

    "abstract": "With the development of deep learning, numerous methods for low-light image\nenhancement (LLIE) have demonstrated remarkable performance. Mainstream LLIE\nmethods typically learn an end-to-end mapping based on pairs of low-light and\nnormal-light images. However, normal-light images under varying illumination\nconditions serve as reference images, making it difficult to define a\n``perfect'' reference image This leads to the challenge of reconciling\nmetric-oriented and visual-friendly results. Recently, many cross-modal studies\nhave found that side information from other related modalities can guide visual\nrepresentation learning. Based on this, we introduce a Natural Language\nSupervision (NLS) strategy, which learns feature maps from text corresponding\nto images, offering a general and flexible interface for describing an image\nunder different illumination.\n  However, image distributions conditioned on textual descriptions are highly\nmultimodal, which makes training difficult. To address this issue, we design a\nTextual Guidance Conditioning Mechanism (TCM) that incorporates the connections\nbetween image regions and sentence words, enhancing the ability to capture\nfine-grained cross-modal cues for images and text. This strategy not only\nutilizes a wider range of supervised sources, but also provides a new paradigm\nfor LLIE based on visual and textual feature alignment. In order to effectively\nidentify and merge features from various levels of image and textual\ninformation, we design an Information Fusion Attention (IFA) module to enhance\ndifferent regions at different levels. We integrate the proposed TCM and IFA\ninto a Natural Language Supervision network for LLIE, named NaLSuper. Finally,\nextensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and superior effectiveness of\nour proposed NaLSuper.",

This constraint\nensures that each agent receives no more than one item per round and receives\neach item at most once. Each agent has an additive valuation on the item--round\npairs. Real-world applications like scheduling, resource management, and\nexperimental design require the Latin square constraint to satisfy fairness or\nbalancedness in allocation.

    "abstract": "The fuzzy job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) emerges as an innovative\nextension to the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), incorporating a layer of\nuncertainty that aligns the problem more closely with the complexities of\nreal-world manufacturing environments. This improvement increases the\ncomputational complexity of deriving the solution while improving its\napplicability. In the domain of deterministic scheduling, neural combinatorial\noptimization (NCO) has recently demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However, its\napplication to the realm of fuzzy scheduling has been relatively unexplored.\nThis paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the feasibility of\nemploying neural networks to assimilate and process fuzzy information for the\nresolution of FJSSP, thereby leveraging the advancements in NCO to enhance\nfuzzy scheduling methodologies. To achieve this, we approach the FJSSP as a\ngenerative task and introduce an expectation-maximization algorithm-based\nautoregressive model (EMARM) to address it. During training, our model\nalternates between generating scheduling schemes from given instances (E-step)\nand adjusting the autoregressive model weights based on these generated schemes\n(M-step). This novel methodology effectively navigates around the substantial\nhurdle of obtaining ground-truth labels, which is a prevalent issue in NCO\nframeworks. In testing, the experimental results demonstrate the superior\ncapability of EMARM in addressing the FJSSP, showcasing its effectiveness and\npotential for practical applications in fuzzy scheduling.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their\nimpressive general-purpose capabilities. For applications requiring intricate\ndomain knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown a distinct\nadvantage in incorporating domain-specific information into LLMs. However,\nexisting RAG research has not fully addressed the challenges of Multiple Choice\nQuestion Answering (MCQA) in telecommunications, particularly in terms of\nretrieval quality and mitigating hallucinations. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel first token probability guided RAG framework. This framework\nleverages confidence scores to optimize key hyperparameters, such as chunk\nnumber and chunk window size, while dynamically adjusting the context. Our\nmethod starts by retrieving the most relevant chunks and generates a single\ntoken as the potential answer. The probabilities of all options are then\nnormalized to serve as confidence scores, which guide the dynamic adjustment of\nthe context. By iteratively optimizing the hyperparameters based on these\nconfidence scores, we can continuously improve RAG performance. We conducted\nexperiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its\npotential to enhance accuracy in domain-specific MCQA tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent successes of artificial intelligence and deep learning often depend on\nthe well-collected training dataset which is assumed to have an identical\ndistribution with the test dataset. However, this assumption, which is called\nclosed-set learning, is hard to meet in realistic scenarios for deploying deep\nlearning models. As one of the solutions to mitigate this assumption, research\non out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has been actively explored in various\ndomains. In OOD detection, we assume that we are given the data of a new class\nthat was not seen in the training phase, i.e., outlier, at the evaluation\nphase. The ultimate goal of OOD detection is to detect and classify such unseen\noutlier data as a novel \"unknown\" class. Among various research branches for\nOOD detection, generating a virtual outlier during the training phase has been\nproposed. However, conventional generation-based methodologies utilize\nin-distribution training dataset to imitate outlier instances, which limits the\nquality of the synthesized virtual outlier instance itself. In this paper, we\npropose a novel methodology for OOD detection named Auxiliary Range Expansion\nfor Outlier Synthesis, or ARES. ARES models the region for generating\nout-of-distribution instances by escaping from the given in-distribution\nregion; instead of remaining near the boundary of in-distribution region.\nVarious stages consists ARES to ultimately generate valuable OOD-like virtual\ninstances. The energy score-based discriminator is then trained to effectively\nseparate in-distribution data and outlier data. Quantitative experiments on\nbroad settings show the improvement of performance by our method, and\nqualitative results provide logical explanations of the mechanism behind it.",

The Hester Davis Score (HDS) is commonly used to assess fall\nrisk, with current clinical practice relying on a threshold-based approach. In\nthis method, a patient is classified as high-risk when their HDS exceeds a\npredefined threshold. However, this approach may fail to capture dynamic\npatterns in fall risk over time. In this study, we model the threshold-based\napproach and propose two machine learning approaches for enhanced fall\nprediction: One-step ahead fall prediction and sequence-to-point fall\nprediction. The one-step ahead model uses the HDS at the current timestamp to\npredict the risk at the next timestamp, while the sequence-to-point model\nleverages all preceding HDS values to predict fall risk using deep learning. We\ncompare these approaches to assess their accuracy in fall risk prediction,\ndemonstrating that deep learning can outperform the traditional threshold-based\nmethod by capturing temporal patterns and improving prediction reliability.\nThese findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to enhance\npatient safety through more reliable fall prevention strategies.",

To further improve the generalization of the distilled dataset, each\nsynthesized image is augmented with a downsampled view of the original image.\nExperimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that, with 100\nimages per class (IPC), ResNet50 and MobileNet-v2 achieve validation accuracies\nof 71.0% and 62.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by\n2.8% and 4.7%. Notably, FocusDD is the first method to use distilled datasets\nfor object detection tasks. On the COCO2017 dataset, with an IPC of 50,\nYOLOv11n and YOLOv11s achieve 24.4% and 32.1% mAP, respectively, further\nvalidating the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Reinsurance optimization is critical for insurers to manage risk exposure,\nensure financial stability, and maintain solvency. Traditional approaches often\nstruggle with dynamic claim distributions, high-dimensional constraints, and\nevolving market conditions. This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that\nintegrates {Generative Models}, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),\nwith {Reinforcement Learning (RL)} using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).\nThe framework enables dynamic and scalable optimization of reinsurance\nstrategies by combining the generative modeling of complex claim distributions\nwith the adaptive decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning.\n  The VAE component generates synthetic claims, including rare and catastrophic\nevents, addressing data scarcity and variability, while the PPO algorithm\ndynamically adjusts reinsurance parameters to maximize surplus and minimize\nruin probability. The framework's performance is validated through extensive\nexperiments, including out-of-sample testing, stress-testing scenarios (e.g.,\npandemic impacts, catastrophic events), and scalability analysis across\nportfolio sizes. Results demonstrate its superior adaptability, scalability,\nand robustness compared to traditional optimization techniques, achieving\nhigher final surpluses and computational efficiency.\n  Key contributions include the development of a hybrid approach for\nhigh-dimensional optimization, dynamic reinsurance parameterization, and\nvalidation against stochastic claim distributions. The proposed framework\noffers a transformative solution for modern reinsurance challenges, with\npotential applications in multi-line insurance operations, catastrophe\nmodeling, and risk-sharing strategy design.",

    "abstract": "From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly\nrealistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These\nmodels have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of\nbillions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many\ncreators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual\nproperty has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out\nof training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have\nquickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model\nwas trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is\ncomputationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model\narchitecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We\nanticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and,\nlooking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI\nmodels.",

To evaluate multimodality-driven voice control, we\nbuild the first multimodality-based voice control (MVC) benchmark, focusing on\nvoice suitability, voice diversity, and speech quality. UniSpeaker is evaluated\nacross five tasks using the MVC benchmark, and the experimental results\ndemonstrate that UniSpeaker outperforms previous modality-specific models.\nSpeech samples are available at \\url{https://UniSpeaker.github.io}.",

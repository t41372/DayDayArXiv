    "abstract": "This study explores a learning-based tri-finger robotic arm manipulating\ntask, which requires complex movements and coordination among the fingers. By\nemploying reinforcement learning, we train an agent to acquire the necessary\nskills for proficient manipulation. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness\nof the learning process, two knowledge transfer strategies, fine-tuning and\ncurriculum learning, were utilized within the soft actor-critic architecture.\nFine-tuning allows the agent to leverage pre-trained knowledge and adapt it to\nnew tasks. Several variations like model transfer, policy transfer, and\nacross-task transfer were implemented and evaluated. To eliminate the need for\npretraining, curriculum learning decomposes the advanced task into simpler,\nprogressive stages, mirroring how humans learn. The number of learning stages,\nthe context of the sub-tasks, and the transition timing were found to be the\ncritical design parameters. The key factors of two learning strategies and\ncorresponding effects were explored in context-aware and context-unaware\nscenarios, enabling us to identify the scenarios where the methods demonstrate\noptimal performance, derive conclusive insights, and contribute to a broader\nrange of learning-based engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language\n(PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an\ninitial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL\ndo not capture temporal aspects of action taking, such as concurrent actions\nbetween two agents when there are no conflicting conditions, without\nsignificant modification and definition to existing PDDL domains. A human\nexpert aware of such constraints can decompose a goal into subgoals, each\nreachable through single agent planning, to take advantage of simultaneous\nactions. In contrast to classical planning, large language models (LLMs)\ndirectly used for inferring plan steps rarely guarantee execution success, but\nare capable of leveraging commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences.\nWe combine the strengths of both classical planning and LLMs by approximating\nhuman intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate\nthat LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving\nmulti-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan\nexecution steps than a single agent plan alone, as well as most multiagent\nplans, while guaranteeing execution success. Additionally, we find that\nLLM-based approximations of subgoals result in similar multi-agent execution\nlengths to those specified by human experts.

These\napproaches typically rely on longitudinal collection of self-reported outcomes,\ne.g., depression, stress, and anxiety, to train machine learning (ML) models.\nHowever, the need to continuously self-report adds a significant burden on the\nparticipants, often resulting in attrition, missing labels, or insincere\nresponses. In this work, we introduce the Scale Scores Simulation using Mental\nModels (SeSaMe) framework to alleviate participants' burden in digital mental\nhealth studies. By leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), SeSaMe\nenables the simulation of participants' responses on psychological scales. In\nSeSaMe, researchers can prompt LLMs with information on participants' internal\nbehavioral dispositions, enabling LLMs to construct mental models of\nparticipants to simulate their responses on psychological scales. We\ndemonstrate an application of SeSaMe, where we use GPT-4 to simulate responses\non one scale using responses from another as behavioral information. We also\nevaluate the alignment between human and SeSaMe-simulated responses to\npsychological scales. Then, we present experiments to inspect the utility of\nSeSaMe-simulated responses as ground truth in training ML models by replicating\nestablished depression and anxiety screening tasks from a previous study. Our\nresults indicate SeSaMe to be a promising approach, but its alignment may vary\nacross scales and specific prediction objectives. We also observed that model\nperformance with simulated data was on par with using the real data for\ntraining in most evaluation scenarios.

In this study, we empirically analyze the generated\noutputs of eleven popular instruct-tuned LLMs with parameters ranging from 1B\nup to 46.7B on 3,820 translation pairs across five languages, including C, C++,\nGo, Java, and Python.

The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on\nsemantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked,\nand we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information\ncan be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a \"semantic node\"\ndata structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data.\nThen, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to\nprocess the \"semantic node\" and generate standardized digital twin models from\nraw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our\nevaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a\nsubstantial proportion of the information from the source text can be\ntranslated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the\ngenerative capability of large language models. This result has a direct\napplication in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is\nimplemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in\ncreating AAS model.

    "abstract": "Crystal structures are indispensable across various domains, from batteries\nto solar cells, and extensive research has been dedicated to predicting their\nproperties based on their atomic configurations. However, prevailing Crystal\nStructure Prediction methods focus on identifying the most stable solutions\nthat lie at the global minimum of the energy function. This approach overlooks\nother potentially interesting materials that lie in neighbouring local minima\nand have different material properties such as conductivity or resistance to\ndeformation. By contrast, Quality-Diversity algorithms provide a promising\navenue for Crystal Structure Prediction as they aim to find a collection of\nhigh-performing solutions that have diverse characteristics. However, it may\nalso be valuable to optimise for the stability of crystal structures alongside\nother objectives such as magnetism or thermoelectric efficiency. Therefore, in\nthis work, we harness the power of Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity algorithms\nin order to find crystal structures which have diverse features and achieve\ndifferent trade-offs of objectives. We analyse our approach on 5 crystal\nsystems and demonstrate that it is not only able to re-discover known real-life\nstructures, but also find promising new ones. Moreover, we propose a method for\nilluminating the objective space to gain an understanding of what trade-offs\ncan be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Most of the recent studies tackling routing problems like the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP) with machine learning use a transformer or Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) based encoder architecture. However, many of them apply these\nencoders naively by allowing them to aggregate information over the whole TSP\ninstances. We, on the other hand, propose a data preprocessing method that\nallows the encoders to focus on the most relevant parts of the TSP instances\nonly. In particular, we propose graph sparsification for TSP graph\nrepresentations passed to GNNs and attention masking for TSP instances passed\nto transformers where the masks correspond to the adjacency matrices of the\nsparse TSP graph representations. Furthermore, we propose ensembles of\ndifferent sparsification levels allowing models to focus on the most promising\nparts while also allowing information flow between all nodes of a TSP instance.\nIn the experimental studies, we show that for GNNs appropriate sparsification\nand ensembles of different sparsification levels lead to substantial\nperformance increases of the overall architecture. We also design a new,\nstate-of-the-art transformer encoder with ensembles of attention masking.

    "abstract": "Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to\nachieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question\nfor MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs\ninference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies,\ni.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper,\nwe conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e.,\nPartitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile,\nEdge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models\nto investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps\ndevelopers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid\nQuantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators\n(Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency\nis a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is\na concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on\nedge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early\nExit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge)\noperators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference\nfor Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile\ndeployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a\nnetwork-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than\nMobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input\ndata samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher\nnetwork/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable\noption than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.",

However, it still struggles with global tasks that require\nunderstanding the broader context in which the robots operate, such as\nidentifying the shape of the arena in which the robots are embedded. Biological\nswarms, such as shoals of fish, flocks of birds, and colonies of insects,\nroutinely solve global geometrical problems through the diffusion of local\ncues. This paradigm can be explicitly described by mathematical models that\ncould be directly computed and exploited by a robotic swarm. Diffusion over a\ndomain is mathematically encapsulated by the Laplacian, a linear operator that\nmeasures the local curvature of a function. Crucially the geometry of a domain\ncan generally be reconstructed from the eigenspectrum of its Laplacian. Here we\nintroduce spectral swarm robotics where robots diffuse information to their\nneighbors to emulate the Laplacian operator - enabling them to \"hear\" the\nspectrum of their arena. We reveal a universal scaling that links the optimal\nnumber of robots (a global parameter) with their optimal radius of interaction\n(a local parameter). We validate experimentally spectral swarm robotics under\nchallenging conditions with the one-shot classification of arena shapes using a\nsparse swarm of Kilobots. Spectral methods can assist with challenging tasks\nwhere robots need to build an emergent consensus on their environment, such as\nadaptation to unknown terrains, division of labor, or quorum sensing.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) focus on aligning to\nheterogeneous human expectations and values via multi-objective preference\nalignment. However, existing methods are dependent on the policy model\nparameters, which require high-cost repetition of their alignment algorithms\nfor each new policy model, and they cannot expand to unseen objectives due to\ntheir static alignment objectives. In this work, we propose Meta-Objective\nAligner (MetaAligner), the first policy-agnostic and generalizable method for\nmulti-objective preference alignment. MetaAligner models multi-objective\nalignment into three stages: (1) dynamic objectives reformulation algorithm\nreorganizes traditional alignment datasets to supervise the model on performing\nflexible alignment across different objectives; (2) conditional weak-to-strong\ncorrection paradigm aligns the weak outputs of fixed policy models to approach\nstrong outputs with higher preferences in the corresponding alignment\nobjectives, enabling plug-and-play inferences on any policy models, which\nsignificantly reduces training costs and facilitates alignment on close-source\npolicy models; (3) generalizable inference method flexibly adjusts target\nobjectives by updating their text descriptions in the prompts, facilitating\ngeneralizable alignment to unseen objectives. Experimental results show that\nMetaAligner achieves significant and balanced improvements in multi-objective\nalignments on 10 state-of-the-art policy models, and saves up to 93.63% of GPU\ntraining hours compared to previous alignment methods. The model also\neffectively aligns unseen objectives, marking the first step towards\ngeneralizable multi-objective preference alignment.",

This paper\nintroduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge\nthrough an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike\nexisting deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed\nprompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capable\nof autonomously planning and executing actions to fix bugs by invoking suitable\ntools. RepairAgent freely interleaves gathering information about the bug,\ngathering repair ingredients, and validating fixes, while deciding which tools\nto invoke based on the gathered information and feedback from previous fix\nattempts. Key contributions that enable RepairAgent include a set of tools that\nare useful for program repair, a dynamically updated prompt format that allows\nthe LLM to interact with these tools, and a finite state machine that guides\nthe agent in invoking the tools. Our evaluation on the popular Defects4J\ndataset demonstrates RepairAgent's effectiveness in autonomously repairing 164\nbugs, including 39 bugs not fixed by prior techniques. Interacting with the LLM\nimposes an average cost of 270,000 tokens per bug, which, under the current\npricing of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, translates to 14 cents of USD per bug.

The ability of\nLLMs to perform tasks in this few-shot manner relies on their background\nknowledge of the task (or task priors). However, recent work has found that,\nunlike traditional learning, LLMs are unable to fully integrate information\nfrom demonstrations that contrast task priors. This can lead to performance\nsaturation at suboptimal levels, especially for subjective tasks such as\nemotion recognition, where the mapping from text to emotions can differ widely\ndue to variability in human annotations. In this work, we design experiments\nand propose measurements to explicitly quantify the consistency of proxies of\nLLM priors and their pull on the posteriors. We show that LLMs have strong yet\ninconsistent priors in emotion recognition that ossify their predictions. We\nalso find that the larger the model, the stronger these effects become.

In this work, we provide a negative answer to\nthis question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to\naddressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline\npolicy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings\nare threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is\ngoverned by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition\nModel jointly determined by the function class and the offline data\ndistribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and\ngeneralizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al.

It introduces the GOLF framework\n(Goal-Oriented Long-term liFe tasks), which focuses on enhancing LLMs' ability\nto assist in significant life decisions through goal orientation and long-term\nplanning. The methodology encompasses a comprehensive simulation study to test\nthe framework's efficacy, followed by model and human evaluations to develop a\ndataset benchmark for long-term life tasks, and experiments across different\nmodels and settings.

By focusing the\ntraining on just 50\\% of the original dataset, specifically on the samples\ncharacterized by the highest loss values, we achieve results comparable to or\nsurpassing those obtained from training on the entire dataset. Interestingly,\nour analysis reveals that the top 5\\% of samples with the highest loss values\nnegatively affect the training process. Excluding these samples and adjusting\nthe selection to favor easier samples further enhances training outcomes.

While existing methods have introduced mechanisms to\nmodulate attribute expression, they typically provide either detailed,\nobject-specific localization of such a modification or full-scale fine-grained,\nnuanced control of attributes. No current approach offers both simultaneously,\nresulting in a gap when trying to achieve precise continuous and\nsubject-specific attribute modulation in image generation.

To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS-Agent SDK, a\ncomprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by\nthe AIOS kernel.

We start by\ndefining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both\nneuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent.\nThe resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically\nplausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep\ncortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously\nactive, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology\nof dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in\nsingle neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift\ntheir output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential\nin both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it\nenables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively\nperforming a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it\npermits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently\napproximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.",

Boreal forests, in particular, are home to\nmany mobility-impeding terrains that should be considered for off-road\nautonomous navigation. Also, being one of the largest land biomes on Earth,\nboreal forests are an area where autonomous vehicles are expected to become\nincreasingly common. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing\nBorealTC, a publicly available dataset for proprioceptive-based terrain\nclassification (TC). Recorded with a Husky A200, our dataset contains 116 min\nof Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), motor current, and wheel odometry data,\nfocusing on typical boreal forest terrains, notably snow, ice, and silty loam.\nCombining our dataset with another dataset from the state-of-the-art, we\nevaluate both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the novel state space\nmodel (SSM)-based Mamba architecture on a TC task. Interestingly, we show that\nwhile CNN outperforms Mamba on each separate dataset, Mamba achieves greater\naccuracy when trained on a combination of both. In addition, we demonstrate\nthat Mamba's learning capacity is greater than a CNN for increasing amounts of\ndata. We show that the combination of two TC datasets yields a latent space\nthat can be interpreted with the properties of the terrains. We also discuss\nthe implications of merging datasets on classification. Our source code and\ndataset are publicly available online:\nhttps://github.com/norlab-ulaval/BorealTC.",

However, the resulting\ngenerative policies inherit the same iterative sampling process of diffusion\nmodels that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, consistency\nmodels proposed learning a new class of generative models that directly map\nnoise to data, resulting in a model that can generate an image in as few as one\nsampling iteration. In this work, to optimize text-to-image generative models\nfor task specific rewards and enable fast training and inference, we propose a\nframework for fine-tuning consistency models via RL. Our framework, called\nReinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), frames the iterative\ninference process of a consistency model as an RL procedure. Comparing to RL\nfinetuned diffusion models, RLCM trains significantly faster, improves the\nquality of the generation measured under the reward objectives, and speeds up\nthe inference procedure by generating high quality images with as few as two\ninference steps. Experimentally, we show that RLCM can adapt text-to-image\nconsistency models to objectives that are challenging to express with\nprompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human\nfeedback, such as aesthetic quality.

Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in\ndecision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics,\nespecially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a\ntypical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the\nlimits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study\ntheir interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and\ngame theory, through the performance metric of \\emph{regret}. We first\nempirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical\n(non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of\nequilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then\nprovide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents,\nunder certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality\nmodel of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify\n(simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To\npromote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \\emph{unsupervised}\ntraining loss of \\emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised\npre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then\nestablish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss\nminimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a\nloss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in\naddressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.",

Given a set of users $U$, a set of permissions $P$ and\na user-permission authorization relation $\\mahtit{UPA}\\subseteq U\\times P$, a\nrole mining algorithm seeks to compute a set of roles $R$, a user-role\nauthorization relation $\\mathit{UA}\\subseteq U\\times R$ and a permission-role\nauthorization relation $\\mathit{PA}\\subseteq R\\times P$, such that the\ncomposition of $\\mathit{UA}$ and $\\mathit{PA}$ is close (in some appropriate\nsense) to $\\mathit{UPA}$.\n  In this paper, we first introduce the Generalized Noise Role Mining problem\n(GNRM) -- a generalization of the MinNoise Role Mining problem -- which we\nbelieve has considerable practical relevance. Extending work of Fomin et al.,\nwe show that GNRM is fixed parameter tractable, with parameter $r + k$, where\n$r$ is the number of roles in the solution and $k$ is the number of\ndiscrepancies between $\\mathit{UPA}$ and the relation defined by the\ncomposition of $\\mathit{UA}$ and $\\mathit{PA}$.

We show that the Pareto front of this\nbi-objective optimization problem (BO-GNRM) can be computed in fixed-parameter\ntractable time with parameter $\\bar{r}+\\bar{k}$.\n  We then report the results of our experimental work using the integer\nprogramming solver Gurobi to solve instances of BO-GNRM. Our key findings are\nthat (a) we obtained strong support that Gurobi's performance is\nfixed-parameter tractable, (b) our results suggest that our techniques may be\nuseful for role mining in practice, based on our experiments in the context of\nthree well-known real-world authorization policies.",

Our study reveals that approximately 60% of\nthe hardware designs generated by LLMs are prone to CWEs, posing potential\nsafety and security risks.

Extensive\nexperimental demonstrates a positive correlation between the number of shots\nand segmentation performance on OOD tasks.

The high loss incurred by client-specific samples in\nheterogeneous label noise poses challenges for distinguishing between\nclient-specific and noisy label samples, impacting the effectiveness of\nexisting label noise learning approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose\nFedFixer, where the personalized model is introduced to cooperate with the\nglobal model to effectively select clean client-specific samples. In the dual\nmodels, updating the personalized model solely at a local level can lead to\noverfitting on noisy data due to limited samples, consequently affecting both\nthe local and global models' performance. To mitigate overfitting, we address\nthis concern from two perspectives. Firstly, we employ a confidence regularizer\nto alleviate the impact of unconfident predictions caused by label noise.\nSecondly, a distance regularizer is implemented to constrain the disparity\nbetween the personalized and global models. We validate the effectiveness of\nFedFixer through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that FedFixer can perform well in filtering noisy label samples on\ndifferent clients, especially in highly heterogeneous label noise scenarios.",

Despite the fast-paced\ndevelopment in deep learning architectures for anomaly detection, model\noptimization for a given dataset is a cumbersome and time-consuming process.\nNeuroevolution could be an effective and efficient solution to this problem, as\na fully automated search method for learning optimal neural networks,\nsupporting both gradient and non-gradient fine tuning. However, existing\nframeworks incorporating neuroevolution lack of support for new layers and\narchitectures and are typically limited to convolutional and LSTM layers.

Our\nmethod overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by optimizing the\nmutation operator in the neuroevolution process, while supporting a wide\nspectrum of neural layers, including attention, dense, and graph convolutional\nlayers. Our extensive experimental evaluation was conducted with widely adopted\nmultivariate anomaly detection benchmark datasets, and showed that the models\ngenerated by AD-NEv++ outperform well-known deep learning architectures and\nneuroevolution-based approaches for anomaly detection.

To\naddress this, we propose aligning multiple sentence representations, such as\nthe [CLS] token, the [MASK] token used in prompting, and entity marker tokens.\nOur method employs contrastive learning to extract complementary discriminative\ninformation from these individual representations. This is particularly\nrelevant in low-resource settings where information is scarce. Leveraging\nmultiple sentence representations is especially effective in distilling\ndiscriminative information for relation classification when additional\ninformation, like relation descriptions, are not available.

    "abstract": "Count data naturally arise in many fields, such as finance, neuroscience, and\nepidemiology, and discovering causal structure among count data is a crucial\ntask in various scientific and industrial scenarios. One of the most common\ncharacteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by\na binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that\ncaptures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count\nscenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival\nfollows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson\ndistribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to\nthe non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e.,\n$X\\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately,\nin this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is\nidentifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to\n$Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed\npath to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching\nStructure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using\nhigh-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the\npath and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained\nfrom the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable\nunder some graphical conditions. A practical algorithm for learning causal\nstructure under PB-SCM is proposed and the experiments demonstrate and verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, due to\nstructural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic\nflow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and\nperiodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the\nkey temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a\ncompact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN\n(Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively\nconsidering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow.\nFirst, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked\nsubseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context\nin a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and\ncontextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series.\nThen, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by\nusing stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are\nextracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making\ntime-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn\nfine-grained short-term temporal features. Finally, LSTTN fuses the long-term\ntrend, periodic features and short-term features to obtain the prediction\nresults. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that in 60-minute-ahead\nlong-term forecasting, the LSTTN model achieves a minimum improvement of 5.63\\%\nand a maximum improvement of 16.78\\% over baseline models.

    "abstract": "Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts\nthe Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes\nthe performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some\nresearch demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via\noptimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs\nalso gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model,\nraising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent\nstudies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated\nto alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of\ncorresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based\nlearning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable\ntokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with\nadaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and\ndevelop $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs\nby a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the\ntarget PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger\ntokens.

Although the latter methods attempt to\nfine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as\nhigh computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones. To address such\nissues, we propose a Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model (Re2LLM) for\nSBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate\nrecommendations effectively and efficiently. In particular, we first design the\nReflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily\nunderstandable and digestible by LLMs. To be specific, we direct LLMs to\nexamine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge\nbase (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors. To efficiently\nelicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement\nUtilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent. It learns to select\nhints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the\nhints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better\nrecommendations.

    "abstract": "Multi-band radiomap reconstruction (MB-RMR) is a key component in wireless\ncommunications for tasks such as spectrum management and network planning.\nHowever, traditional machine-learning-based MB-RMR methods, which rely heavily\non simulated data or complete structured ground truth, face significant\ndeployment challenges. These challenges stem from the differences between\nsimulated and actual data, as well as the scarcity of real-world measurements.\nTo address these challenges, our study presents RadioGAT, a novel framework\nbased on Graph Attention Network (GAT) tailored for MB-RMR within a single\narea, eliminating the need for multi-region datasets. RadioGAT innovatively\nmerges model-based spatial-spectral correlation encoding with data-driven\nradiomap generalization, thus minimizing the reliance on extensive data\nsources. The framework begins by transforming sparse multi-band data into a\ngraph structure through an innovative encoding strategy that leverages radio\npropagation models to capture the spatial-spectral correlation inherent in the\ndata. This graph-based representation not only simplifies data handling but\nalso enables tailored label sampling during training, significantly enhancing\nthe framework's adaptability for deployment. Subsequently, The GAT is employed\nto generalize the radiomap information across various frequency bands.\nExtensive experiments using raytracing datasets based on real-world\nenvironments have demonstrated RadioGAT's enhanced accuracy in supervised\nlearning settings and its robustness in semi-supervised scenarios. These\nresults underscore RadioGAT's effectiveness and practicality for MB-RMR in\nenvironments with limited data availability.",

Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial\nstep in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years\ndue to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of\nadditional chemical knowledge dependency.\n  Results: This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence\npipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and\nTransformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph\nstructure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule\nstructures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet\neffective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged\nstructures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method\nsubstantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and\nsemi-template-based approaches. Importantly, our template-free method achieves\neffectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful\ntemplate-based methods.\n  Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free\nretrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of\nTransformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient\nutilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning\nmechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES\ntokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based\napproaches, with up to 5\\% (top-5) and 5.4\\% (top-10) increased accuracy over\nthe strongest baseline.",

    "abstract": "The wide adoption of Large language models (LLMs) makes their dependability a\npressing concern. Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their\nimpact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important\nissue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to\nthe internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that\nneed access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that\nthe output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text.\nTherefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal\ntext, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose\nto perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts\nsome linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a\nconcurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection\nmechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs\nin which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has\nbeen evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the\nOPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of\nlinguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the\napplicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case. The results show\nthat CLED can detect most of the errors at a low overhead penalty. The use of\nthe concurrent classifier also enables a trade-off between error detection\neffectiveness and its associated overhead, so providing flexibility to a\ndesigner.",

    "abstract": "Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still\nbeen faced with several challenges. First, the inherent imbalance in the\ndistribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased\nfocus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses. Second, the\nfrequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm\nthe critical abnormal information. Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest\nX-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional\nnature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs. Recently,\nLLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate\nprompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges. In this\npaper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report\ngeneration by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts.\nConsidering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with\nperceiver to extract the visual information. To tailor the LLM for report\ngeneration and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic\ninformation by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated\nduring training to capture common disease representations. Furthermore, we\nintroduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for\ndifferent diseases.

Amid this renaissance, a pivotal issue emerges: should users of\nGenerative AI be recognized as authors eligible for copyright protection? The\nCopyright Office, in its March 2023 Guidance, argues against this notion. By\ncomparing the prompts to clients' instructions for commissioned art, the Office\ndenies users authorship due to their limited role in the creative process. This\nArticle challenges this viewpoint and advocates for the recognition of\nGenerative AI users who incorporate these tools into their creative endeavors.\nIt argues that the current policy fails to consider the intricate and dynamic\ninteraction between Generative AI users and the models, where users actively\ninfluence the output through a process of adjustment, refinement, selection,\nand arrangement. Rather than dismissing the contributions generated by AI, this\nArticle suggests a simplified and streamlined registration process that\nacknowledges the role of AI in creation. This approach not only aligns with the\nconstitutional goal of promoting the progress of science and useful arts but\nalso encourages public engagement in the creative process, which contributes to\nthe pool of training data for AI. Moreover, it advocates for a flexible\nframework that evolves alongside technological advancements while ensuring\nsafety and public interest.

ChatDBG integrates large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and\nuser-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in\na collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex\nquestions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or\nassertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like \"why is x null?\". To\nhandle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to \"take the wheel\": it\ncan act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the\ndebugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports\nits findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the\nreal-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable\nonly through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype\nintegrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and\nPdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++\ncode with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts\nand Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root\ncauses, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of\nreal-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable\nbug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success\nrate to 85%.
